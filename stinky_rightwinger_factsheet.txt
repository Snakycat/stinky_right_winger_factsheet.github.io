Japanese one-party rule incorporated the nuclear industry, which resulted in less powerful and less transparent regulation: <https://www.cairn.info/revue-annales-historiques-de-l-electricite-2003-1-page-133.htm> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/727595692201214012/AHE_001_0133.pdf> """In Japan, there is considerable stress on voluntary compliance with nuclear regulations, which are less strict in the critical plant operating stage.""""""And it is the reasons for this “behind the scenes” collaboration that must be analyzed here, based upon the gap between theory and practice in the case of Japanese nuclear regulation. First of all, while Japan’s Diet [Parliament] was, in theory, based upon an “open” multi-party parliamentary system, in practice, it acquired a centralized “Byzantine-like” nature based upon a party-political “machine”, i.e. the long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) that was essentially unresponsive to changing or competing interests and changes in the composition of interest groups. The desire of LDP “beneficiaries” — such as the Japanese nuclear-industrial complex — were facilitated by governmental organizations with which they were closely linked. What occurred in Japan, therefore, was that the centralized government agencies regulating nuclear power, MITI and NSC (Nuclear Safety Commission), simply collaborated on safety issues to the benefit of the Japanese nuclear-industrial complex. Secondly, in Japan, not only were the parliamentary and regulatory structures centralized, but the nature of the domestic power interests — industries and utilities — was also monolithic and uncompetitive."""

(Over the same period, there were also 17 populist governments that cannot easily be classified as either right- or left-wing; again, five of these governments diminished civil liberties and political rights.)

In Switzerland (1974), where compulsory voting was only partially abolished, it fell from 53.2% in 1967 to 43.6% in 1975 (and to a historic low of 34.9% in 1999). In the only canton where voting remained compulsory, turnout is up to 20% higher than in the others (IDEA, 2004, 26–29). In the Philippines (from 1972 until 1987) turnout rose from 53.5% in 1967 to 78.6% in 1978 and fell from 78.2 per cent in 1987 to 65.3 in 1992 (and 64.8% in 2001).

Before 1986, turnout nowhere deviated much from the average of 95.2% of registered citizens. It rose from 91.6% in 1980 to almost 95% in 1986 in regions retaining compulsory voting and dropped to 85% in regions abolishing it."""

Although this method tends to overestimate turnout in voluntary voting (would-be abstainers are more likely not to respond at all), results show that abolishing compulsory voting would probably lead to a decline of about 30% in countries like Australia (Jackman, 2001, 16316) and Belgium (Hooghe and Pelleriaux, 1998, 420–421)."""

This assumption has been empirically confirmed. In their cross-country comparison, Mueller and Stratmann (2003, 2151) found that political participation has a positive impact on income equality.

# libertarian objections: freedom to stay at home

This argument functions as some kind of rock-bottom: I oppose compulsory voting because it infringes on my freedom by which I may well prefer to stay at home. One can doubt whether the resistance of opponents who prefer to stay at home is really based on libertarian conscientious objections. Against those who abstain because of pragmatic considerations, one can argue that attending the polling station every two or three years is not too much to ask, especially compared to governmental obligations such as compulsory education and tax duties, which are much more time-consuming (Keaney and Rogers, 2006, 7, 30, 35). Given the importance of democracy, I believe a government has every right and reason to demand this much from its citizens"""

Take, for example, the study that is probably the nation’s only truly real-world political advertising field experiment. During Rick Perry’s 2006 re-election campaign for Texas governor, a team of researchers convinced Perry’s campaign to run ads in randomly assigned markets and then tracked the effect of those ads over time using surveys. Advertising did produce a pro-Perry response in the markets that received the treatment. But that bump fizzled fast. Within a week after ads stopped running, it was like no one had ever seen them. <https://www.jstor.org/stable/41480831> <https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/abs/DA29FE8A5581C772006A1DEBB21CFC4C> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1017/S000305541000047X>

# participation [UNFORMATTED, UNREAD]
Ongoing research from Alexander Fouirnaies, professor of public policy at the University of Chicago, suggests that, as it becomes normal for campaigns to spend higher and higher amounts, fewer people run and more of those who do are independently wealthy. In other words, the arms race of unnecessary campaign spending could help to enshrine power among the well-known and privileged. <https://www.dropbox.com/s/t96hcfls5a1g3ss/SpendingLimits.pdf>

# independence: appointed judges and partisan judges tend to vote in favor of the state government (not independent)
justices selected by the legislature or governor and justices elected in partisan races are more likely to vote in favor of the state, and this likelihood increases as they approach the end of their term (regression coefficient = percentage point difference in cases decided): <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1910897> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/728329767782318110/shepherd2009b.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/728435540986429460/unknown.png """The magnitudes of the marginal effects are statistically significant, but not huge.

# history of judicial elections
judicial elections emerged as an anti-corruption reform: <https://today.law.harvard.edu/book-review/in-new-book-shugerman-explores-the-history-of-judicial-selection-in-the-u-s/> """Shugerman discovered that at first the plan to create a more independent judiciary through popular elections worked. The first generation of elected judges in the early 19th century exercised the power of judicial review far more often than their predecessors did. Perhaps ironically, these democratically elected judges were also the first to criticize democratic excesses and to argue from a countermajoritarian perspective.""""""“I began the book feeling horrified by American judicial elections,” Shugerman says. When his research revealed that a significant impetus behind them was to correct for the corruption and partisanship of judicial appointments, he saw that judicial elections had a good-faith logic in their 19th-century context. From the republic’s earliest days, Shugerman notes, the challenge of judicial selection has been to balance judicial accountability, which demands that judges bend to popular and political pressures, and judicial independence, which demands judicial allegiance to the rule of law. As he mined the historical record, he found that judicial election advocates vied for popular support for their cause by framing it primarily in terms of judicial independence.""""""Of all the methods he looks at, Shugerman claims that merit selection, which involves vetting by a panel of professionals and executive appointment to a first term, followed by retention elections, has yielded the most judicial independence. It is currently employed in about 20 states. But he warns that it, too, may be adversely affected by the excessive campaign spending that preceded and may now be accelerated indirectly by Citizens United.""" [unformatted]

# game theory
minimum demand: balanced courts; maximum demand: court reform --> game theory: structure demand in such a way that escalation (accepting minimum demand but rejecting maximum demand) is less desireable than reform (accepting maximum demand)

# proposal
my proposal: the ranked choice term limited or RCTL supreme court
- 20 year term limit
^ prevents any president from appointing more than 8/20=40% of the court
^ prevents justices from exceeding historical term limit
- every 2 years, ranked choice selection of 5 justices (total court size: 50)
^ ensures ~2 lib, ~2 con, ~1 moderate

# federalist papers
federalist no. 78: <https://guides.loc.gov/federalist-papers/text-71-80#:~:text=has%20no%20influence,purse&text=and%20must%20ultimately,judgments> The legislature not only commands the purse, but prescribes the rules by which the duties and rights of every citizen are to be regulated. The judiciary, on the contrary, has no influence over either the sword or the purse; no direction either of the strength or of the wealth of the society; and can take no active resolution whatever. It may truly be said to have neither FORCE nor WILL, but merely judgment; and must ultimately depend upon the aid of the executive arm even for the efficacy of its judgments.

# ginsberg quotes
Ginsberg opposed court-packing because she felt it would reduce judicial independence: <https://www.npr.org/2019/07/24/744633713/justice-ginsburg-i-am-very-much-alive> """"If anything would make the court look partisan, it would be that — one side saying, 'When we're in power, we're going to enlarge the number of judges, so we would have more people who would vote the way we want them to.' We are blessed in the way no other judiciary in the world is. We have life tenure. The only way to get rid of a federal judge is by impeachment. Congress can't retaliate by reducing our salary, so the safeguards for judicial independence in this country, I think, are as great or greater than anyplace else in the world.""""
Ginsberg's argument hinges on the idea that people follow the judiciary's rulings: <https://www.npr.org/2019/07/24/744633713/justice-ginsburg-i-am-very-much-alive> """But the whole notion of the country's independent judiciary hinges on public trust, she noted. "The court has no troops at its command," Ginsburg pointed out, "doesn't have the power of the purse, and yet time and again, when the courts say something, people accept it." She recalled Bush v. Gore, the controversial case in which the Supreme Court stopped a Florida recount in the 2000 presidential election. "I dissented from that decision," Ginsburg said. "I thought it was unwise. A lot of people disagreed with it. And yet the day after the court rendered its decision, there were no riots in the streets. People adjusted to it. And life went on.""""

# more cops less crime / overpoliced and underprotected: true but complicated

More cops means less violent crime -- but at significant public expense, especially given the egregious underfunding of US welfare system. Re-allocation of cop time to *street presence* (or replaced/supplemented by community volunteers) may have similar effects.

But many more of them — 85 percent — said that increasing spending on housing, health and education would do so. <https://cjexpertpanel.org/surveys/policing-and-public-safety/>

Indeed an array of high-quality research suggests that crime can, in certain contexts, be reduced through methods other than policing or its by-product, incarceration. Among the many alternatives to police for which there is promising evidence are placebased crime control strategies such as increasing the availability of trees and green space (Branas et al., 2011), restoring vacant lots (Branas et al., 2016, 2018; Moyer et al., 2019), public-private partnerships (Cook and MacDonald, 2011), street lighting (Doleac and Sanders, 2015; Chalfin et al., 2019), and reducing physical disorder (Sampson and Raudenbush, 2001; Keizer et al., 2008). There is also evidence that social service-based strategies such as summer jobs for disadvantaged youth (Heller, 2014; Gelber et al., 2016; Davis and Heller, 2017), cognitive behavioral therapy (Blattman et al., 2017; Heller et al., 2017), mental health treatment (Deza et al., 2020) and local non-profits more generally (Sharkey et al., 2017) can have important crime-reducing effects. While social service terventions are often difficult to scale (Mofiitt, 2006; Ludwig et al., 2011), the increasing number of studies which show that there are ways to reduce crime outside the deterrence channels of the traditional model of Becker (1968) is encouraging."""

About a year ago, Stephen Mello of Princeton University assessed the Obama-era increase in federal police funding. Thanks to the stimulus bill, funding for Clinton’s Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) hiring grant program surged from about $20 million a year in the late-Bush era to $1 billion in 2009. The program design allowed Mello to assess some quasi-random variation in which cities got grants. The data shows that compared to cities that missed out, those that made the cut ended up with police staffing levels that were 3.2 percent higher and crime levels that were 3.5 percent lower.

# mechanism: not through incapacitation but through deterrence

It’s important in that context to note a recent study by John MacDonald, Jeffrey Fagan, and Amanda Geller that looked at localized policing surges in New York City (dubbed “Operation Impact” by the NYPD) over a period of years. They found that surges led to both less crime and more “stop and frisk”-type incidents where officers stopped citizens (typically young black or Latino men) without probable cause. That suggests a sharp trade-off between crime reduction and civil rights. But the same study, by looking at the covariance of “stop and frisks” and crime reduction, found that the additional stops were doing nothing to reduce crime. All of the anti-crime impact, in other words, came from putting more cops on the beat rather than from the use of aggressive tactics. New York City, not coincidentally, has continued to enjoy low and falling crime rates since stop and frisk tactics were curtailed. What’s helpful is more officers, not more harassment. <https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0157223> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1371/journal.pone.0157223> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/751274851616030800/macdonald2016.PDF>

This could occur through changes in policy like the decriminalization of drug possession or via efforts to recruit a larger number of Black or female police officers (Donohue III and Levitt, 2001; McCrary, 2007; West, 2018; Miller and Segal, 2019; Harvey and Mattia, 2019; Ba and Rivera, 2020; Linos and Riesch, 2020). Moreover, there is growing evidence to support the efficacy of de-escalation training (Engel et al., 2020) and procedural justice training (Owens et al., 2018; Nagin and Telep, 2020; Wood et al., 2020), federal oversight of police agencies (Powell et al., 2017; Goh, 2020), and the use of and training in non-lethal weapons (MacDonald et al., 2009; Sousa et al., 2010). There is likewise support for the idea that reforms to police unions may be effective (Dharmapala et al., 2019) especially if unions can be incentivized to “self-regulate,” which could take the form of transferring the burden of liability insurance from municipalities to unions (Ramirez et al., 2018; Ba and Rivera, 2019). Finally, police officers tend to be highly responsive to managerial directives (Mummolo, 2018), which suggests that procedural reforms could meaningfully alter officer behavior even holding police force size fixed."""

# implication: more workers, shorter shifts: fight fatigue [xxx reread]
The key mechanism here is fatigue — which while obviously not a substitute for curing systemic racism, is a lot easier to fix with concrete short-term steps. Tired officers, across a variety of studies, generate more complaints from the civilians they interact with. https://www.governing.com/topics/public-justice-safety/gov-police-officers-overworked-cops.html
A 2017 audit of the Kings County Sheriff’s Department in Washington found that working a single hour of overtime led to a 2.7 percent increase in the odds that the officer would be involved in a use-of-force incident the following week. https://www.kingcounty.gov/~/media/depts/auditor/new-web-docs/2017/kcao-overtime-2017/kcao-overtime-2017.ashx?la=en
A 2015 study of police officers in Phoenix found that being assigned to a 13-hour rather than 10-hour shift led to increases in fatigue and Professional Standards Bureau complaints. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1098611115584910?journalCode=pqxa
A 2018 study found that working back-to-back night shifts increased the odds of public complaints, and that the effect is particularly large when the officers had to make court appearances in the daytime between the night shifts. https://academic.oup.com/sleep/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/sleep/zsy231/5195409?redirectedFrom=fulltext

In more recent years, it was found that in 1999, 45.4% of individuals and in 2004, 43.3% of individuals were re-incarcerated within three years of their release (Pew Center on the States, 2011). <https://www.themarshallproject.org/2014/12/04/the-misleading-math-of-recidivism>

Prisons should not be used with the expectation of reducing criminal behaviour. 2. On the basis of the present results, excessive use of incarceration has enormous cost implications. 3. In order to determine who is being adversely affected by prison, it is incumbent upon prison officials to implement repeated, comprehensive assessments of offenders’ attitudes, values, and behaviours while incarcerated. 4. The primary justification of prison should be to incapacitate offenders (particularly, those of a chronic, higher risk nature) for reasonable periods and to exact retribution.`

# recidivism: negative effects
Falk 2013: in Sweden from 1973-2004, persistent violent offenders (3+ convictions) did the majority of violent crime [sexual violence excluded]: 0.12% of the population received 19.8% of the violent crime convictions (1/10 do 20), 1.02% received 63.2% (1 do 63), and 3.91% received all 100% (4 do 100); compared with sex- and age-matched non-offenders, violent offenders were significantly more likely to have personality and mental disorders, violent convictions before 19 and , and nonviolent criminality: <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00127-013-0783-y> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1007/s00127-013-0783-y> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/865143068180217866/falk2013.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/865137886000578560/127_2013_783_Fig2_HTML.png

Persistence in violence was associated with male sex (OR 2.5), personality disorder (OR 2.3), violent crime conviction before age 19 (OR 2.0), drug-related offenses (OR 1.9), nonviolent criminality (OR 1.9), substance use disorder (OR 1.9), and major mental disorder (OR 1.3). [....] Among individuals convicted of one violent crime, 44% (41,257 of 93,642) were reconvicted. After 2 violent convictions, 59% (24,342 of 41,257) were reconvicted, and after 3 convictions, 68% (16,435 of 24,342) were reconvicted.

In MST, therapists lead a regimented three- to five-month family intervention process involving multiple contacts each week in the family’s home and surrounding community. FFT employs office-based counseling (an average of 12 sessions) designed first to engage family members and then to support meaningful behavior changes that improve family interaction and address the underlying causes of delinquent behavior. Costs average $6,000 to $9,500 per youth for MST and $3,000 to $3,500 for FFT, whereas **a typical stay in a juvenile corrections facility (9 to 12 months at $241 per day) costs $66,000 to $88,000.**

# crime
the illegal drug market causes violent crime and cannot be solved by increased law enforcement: <http://www.ijdp.org/article/S0955-3959(11)00022-3/fulltext> The present systematic review demonstrates that drug law enforcement interventions are unlikely to reduce drug market violence. Instead, and contrary to the conventional wisdom that increasing drug law enforcement will reduce violence, the existing scientific evidence base suggests that drug prohibition likely contributes to drug market violence and increased homicide rates and that increasingly sophisticated methods of disrupting illicit drug distribution networks may in turn increase levels of violence.

Over one-third of wives of police officers (37%) reported violence in their marriage. (Neidig, Russell, and Seng, unpublished). A 1981 survey of Toronto police officers found a divorce and separation rate of 63%, almost double the national average among Canadians at the time. Recent studies indicate that as many as 75% of police marriages in large metropolitan areas are likely to end in divorce. (Came, et al., 1989). [....] A 1986 review suggested that as many as 30% of all police officers abuse alcohol, compared with less than 10% of the population at large. (Hepp, 1987)

education reduces inequality: <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/joes.12056> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/536584643957227530/unknown.png The conditional MRA predictions reported in Table 3 suggest that education has had no effect on average levels of inequality when measured by the Gini coefficient. However, the MRA also indicates that education has led to a compression in incomes: it has resulted in reduced income inequality at both ends of the income distribution. The results also suggest that compared to primary schooling, secondary schooling and educational attainment are more effective at reducing inequality.

If the income share of the top 20 percent increases by 1 percentage point, GDP growth is actually 0.08 percentage point lower in the following five years, suggesting that the benefits do not trickle down. Instead, a similar increase in the income share of the bottom 20 percent (the poor) is associated with 0.38 percentage point higher growth. This positive relationship between disposable income shares and higher growth continues to hold for the second and third quintiles (the middle class). This result survives a variety of robustness checks, and is in line with recent findings for a smaller sample of advanced economies (OECD 2014)."""

The negative impact of an uneven distribution of income is higher in less developed countries.""""""The longer the length of the growth period (ie, from 5 to 10 to 20 years), the lower the coefficient estimates of the correlation between income and economic growth [become]. This result supports the assertion that the mechanism at the basis of the relationship between inequality and growth works differently in the short run as compared to the long run. We also found that the quality of data on income inequality and economic growth is weaker, regardless whether the correlation is estimated to be positive or negative."""

As in Dominicis et al.’s (2008) our results suggest that for a 5% level of significance: the effect of inequality on growth is negative and more pronounced in less developed countries than in rich countries; the inclusion of regional dummies in the growth regression of the primary studies considerably weakens such effect; expenditure and gross income inequality tend to lead to different estimates of the effect size. However, contrary to it Dominicis et al. (2008), we find that: the impact of inequality on growth is not significantly influenced by the quality of the data on income distribution or by the use of different panel estimation techniques; crosssection studies systematically report a stronger negative impact than panel data studies. Furthermore, our results suggest that wealth inequality is more pernicious to subsequent growth than income inequality is. With the exception of the impact of using expenditure versus gross income, all these results are robust."""

Temporal change in the Gini is also shown to be a significant predictor of temporal change in provincial homicide rates. When Canadian provinces and U.S. states are considered together, local levels of income inequality appear to be sufficient to account for the two countries' radically different national homicide rates.

# wealth inequality from inheritance
inheritance accounts for 50-60% of the effect of parental wealth on child wealth: <http://ftp.iza.org/dp10126.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/537339413450063884/unknown.png The results suggest that bequests are an important source of an individual’s wealth status. Regressing child wealth rank on inheritance rank (columns 1 and 4) show high and statistically significant correlations between 0.32 and 0.38. Turning to the baseline generational equation (columns 2 and 5), parental wealth correlations are around the same levels as seen before, between 0.26 and 0.31. When adding ranked inheritance to the baseline model (columns 3 and 6), parental wealth correlations drop to 0.12 and 0.14, which represents a drop of between 50 and 60 per cent. This is a remarkably large reduction, suggesting that inherited wealth accounts for the majority of the measured intergenerational wealth correlation.
direct transfers probably account for most of the environmental correlation between parent and child wealth: <https://www.nber.org/papers/w21409.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/537336682807296050/unknown.png Column 6 of Table 5 presents the estimates when we control for all these possible mechanisms together. All together, we can explain almost 50% of the effect of the biological parent’s wealth effect on children’s wealth, while we are able to explain only a bit more than 20% of the adoptive parent’s wealth effect. 47 Given that most of the environmental effect remains unexplained by earnings, savings rates, and investment returns, direct financial transfers from parents to children are a likely explanation for much of the environmental effect. 48 However, we do not have data on financial transfers that would allow us to study this directly.

# wasted
inheritances are squandered: <https://www.nber.org/papers/w12569.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/542511150122663947/unknown.png The estimated coefficient on the latter is 0.79 with a standard error of 0.03. This suggests that wealth increases by only $0.79 for every dollar in inheritance received. Alternatively stated, individuals consume 21 percent of the inheritance received. With an adjusted R squared of 0.53, inheritances seem to explain quite a bit of the observed change in wealth.

# reduced labor-force participation

The estimated coefficient on inheritances becomes -2.66 (se=0.85), with an estimated marginal effect of -0.035 (se=0.018).14 An inheritance of $1 million, other things equal, reduces labor force participation by about 11 percent.

In particular, between 2004 and 2008, the number of single homeless individuals hovered between 7,400 and 7,960. Finland’s annual homeless reports attributed the stalled progress to a group of people with high support needs who were experiencing long-term homelessness, analogous to chronic homelessness in the United States (Pleace, 2017). Researchers suggested that the staircase approach “can work well with those who have opted for substance abuse rehabilitation and can cope with shared housing. However, the insistence on service users being intoxicant-free and able to take control of their lives has proven to be an insuperable barrier for many homeless people with multiple problems” (Tainio and Fredriksson, 2009: 188)."""

# public spending in the gilded era [unformatted, reread xxx]
there was never a time when the state was uninvolved in helping the needy: <https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/32/the-voluntarism-fantasy/> [A] significant amount of research has been done over the past several decades to overturn the myth of a stateless nineteenth century and to rediscover the lost role of the state in the pre-New Deal world. [....] As the political scientist Theda Skocpol has documented, there were also multiple examples of state-issued social insurance programs before the New Deal. In the wake of the Civil War, Congress established an elaborate system of pensions for veterans. At its height in 1910, this de facto disability and old-age pension system delivered benefits to more than 25 percent of all American men over 65, accounting for a quarter of the federal government’s expenditures. Between 1911 and 1920, 40 states passed laws establishing “mothers’ pensions” for single women with children. These programs provided payments for needy widowed mothers in order to allow them to provide for their children.

# private charity is procyclical (reduces in recessions: bad)
private charity stays around 2% of GDP: private charity is procyclical -- it declines during recessions and increases during expansions -- meaning that private charity increases recession depth: <https://slate.com/business/2014/03/private-charity-and-the-safety-net-why-philanthropy-cant-replace-government.html> <https://inequality.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/CharitableGiving_fact_sheet.pdf> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/939388847509360730/reich2012.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/636700753716576296/unknown.png """It is perhaps reassuring that there’s no evidence of increasing stinginess in times of need. Then again, neither is there evidence of increased largesse, which is problematic because need is countercyclical. Indeed, because needs increase dramatically as the economy contracts, our reliance on charity and the nonprofit sector contains some built-in structural challenges, at least relative to other countries that can more readily engage in direct governmental spending when additional needs must be met."""

# public spending is countercyclical (increases in recessions: good)
in 2008-09, public spending jumped from .1 to 2.2% of GDP: in contrast, automatic stabilizers are countercyclical -- they increase during recessions and decrease during expansions -- meaning that public spending decreases recession depth: <https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/32/the-voluntarism-fantasy/> During 2009, while private charity collapsed, automatic stabilizers expanded rapidly, from 0.1 percent of GDP to 2.2 percent of GDP—or a number roughly akin to all charitable giving in the United States. This was directly targeted at areas that suffered from the most unemployment, and helped those most in need—efforts that, as we’ve seen, private charity does only partially. As Goldman Sachs economists concluded, this shift made a crucial difference, and, alongside the government’s efforts to prevent the collapse of the banking sector and the Federal Reserve’s expansion of monetary policy, was a core reason the Great Recession didn’t become a second Great Depression.

# causes: prices
most cost increases are due to price increases rather than utilization increases: <https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/1769890> Since 2000, (1) price (especially of hospital charges [+4.2%/y], professional services [+3.6%/y], drugs and devices [+4.0%/y], and administrative costs [+5.6%/y]), not demand for services or aging of the population, produced 91% of cost increases; (2) personal out-of-pocket spending on insurance premiums and co-payments have declined from 23% to 11%; and (3) chronic illnesses account for 84% of costs overall among the entire population, not only of the elderly.
Americans receive less on virtually every metric of "real" care delivered, yet pay more: <https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.22.3.89> """As shown in Exhibits 4 and 5 , in 2000 the United States had fewer physicians per 1,000 population, physician visits per capita, acute care beds per capita, hospital admissions per 1,000 population, and acute care days per capita than the median OECD country. These simple comparisons suggest that Americans are receiving fewer real resources than are people in the median OECD country.""""""The researchers estimated that Americans paid 40 percent more per capita than Germans did but received 15 percent fewer real health care resources. A similar comparison revealed that the U.S. system used about 30 percent more inputs per capita than was used in the British system and spent about 75 percent more per capita on higher prices."""
since 1960, price increases have represented >50% of each year's increase in national health expenditure: <https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/Downloads/HistoricalNHEPaper.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/571189074241781763/unknown.png

# causes: administration
administrative spending as a portion of overall healthcare spending is 8% in the US (compared to a mean of 3% for other high-income countries): <https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2674671> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/472872275402817556/unknown.png
overhead takes 31% of US healthcare but just 17% of Canadian healthcare spending: <https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmsa022033> In 1999, health administration costs totaled at least $294.3 billion in the United States, or $1,059 per capita, as compared with $307 per capita in Canada. After exclusions, administration accounted for 31.0 percent of health care expenditures in the United States and 16.7 percent of health care expenditures in Canada. Canada's national health insurance program had overhead of 1.3 percent; the overhead among Canada's private insurers was higher than that in the United States (13.2 percent vs. 11.7 percent). Providers' administrative costs were far lower in Canada.
in 2014, administrative expenses (including fraud and abuse control expenses) were $8.8 billion of $613.3 billion total expenditures (1.43%): <https://www.cms.gov/research-statistics-data-and-systems/statistics-trends-and-reports/reportstrustfunds/downloads/tr2015.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/640291423165349903/unknown.png
in 2017, administrative costs and profits accounted for $144.1 billion of $1183.9 billion (12.2%) for private insurance, $36.1 of $705.9 (5.11%) for Medicare, and $33.6 of $581.9 (5.77%) for Medicaid: <https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/NationalHealthAccountsHistorical.html> (NHE tables, Table 4)
administrative costs  were 13% overall (11% for large group plans, 16% for small group plans, and 20% for individual plans) and profits were 2% overall (2% for large group plans, 3% for small group plans, and -1% for nongroup plans) for private insurance from 2010-2012: <https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/114th-congress-2015-2016/reports/51130-Health_Insurance_Premiums.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/640271316188004373/unknown.png

# fraud: private vs public
fraud elimination has been effective: <http://archive.is/Dn9UB> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/543707411131924482/20140531_USC154.png Federal prosecutors had over 2,000 health-fraud probes open at the end of 2013. A Medicare “strike force”, which was formed in 2007, boasts of seven nationwide “takedowns”. In the latest, on May 13th, 90 people, including 16 doctors, were rounded up in six cities—more than half of them in Miami, the capital city of medical fraud. One doctor is alleged to have fraudulently charged for $24m of kit, including 1,000 power wheelchairs.
the reason Medicare has high fraud rates is because they pay out without checking whether a bill is legitimate(!): <http://medicareintegrity.org/error-rate-drops-but-medicare-still-lost-31-6-billion-to-preventable-billing-errors-in-fy2018/> """Like private payers, Medicare can leverage pre-payment audits to prevent improper payments. In FY2012, CMS successfully tested prepayment audits during the Medicare Prepayment Review Demonstration project. Recovery Audit Contractors (RACs) were authorized to review certain error prone Medicare claims for billing accuracy before they were paid. As a result of this short pilot program RACs prevented more than $192 million in improper payments from leaving the Medicare Trust Funds in error. The pilot program was so successful that the GAO recommended that “CMS should actively seek legislative authority to have RAs conduct prepayment claim reviews.”"""
the fraud rate of medicare fee-for-service is about 2x that of healthcare at large: <http://web.archive.org/web/20070813221400/http://www.nhcaa.org/eweb/DynamicPage.aspx?webcode=anti_fraud_resource_centr&wpscode=TheProblemOfHCFraud> Each year, for example, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services conducts a formal audit of the Medicare program’s fee-for-service claim payment system. On February 21, 2002, the HHS-OIG reported its finding that of the $191.8 billion such claims paid in 2001, 6.3 percent – amounting to $12.1 billion – should not have been paid due to erroneous billing or payment, inadequate provider documentation of services to back up the claims and/or outright fraud. In May, 2004, the National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association (NHCAA) reported in its Anti-Fraud Management Survey that 52 of its member insurers collectively recovered or prevented payment of $503 million in 2003 as a direct result of their anti-fraud activities – a great deal of money, but barely a measurable fraction of the total estimated loss. The bottom line: The NHCAA estimates that of the nation’s annual health care outlay, at least 3 percent – or $51 billion in calendar-year 2003- is lost to outright fraud. Other estimates by government and law enforcement agencies place the loss as high as 10 percent of our annual expenditure – or $170 billion – each year.
medicare-medicaid improperly pays about $65 billion per year (8.7% of $743 billion total): <https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/04/darrell-issa/rep-darrell-issa-claims-government-could-save-125-/> <https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2010/11/16/improper-payment-progress> <https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/Background_on_Accountable_Government_Initiative.pdf> On June 8, 2010, the President announced that the Administration would cut the improper payment rate in the Medicare Fee for Service program in half by FY 2012. Considering that Medicare and Medicaid combined had about $65 billion in improper payments in FY 2009 including about $35 billion in Medicare Fee For Service alone, halving the improper payment rate would help avoid more than $20 billion in payment errors by FY 2012. [....] About a third of Medicare's improper payments are the result of a claim not having enough, or proper, documentation. Upon further investigation, many of those claims are ultimately deemed proper. One example is a payment based on a claim by a doctor who submits forms that are illegible. Also, not all improper claims can be completely recouped. For example, say a surgeon was paid $10,000 for an inpatient procedure when Medicare only reimburses for an outpatient procedure that costs $5,000. The government wouldn't recoup the full $10,000, just the $5,000.
the overall cost of fraud is estimated at $85 billion to $272 billion per year: <https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/1148376> Fraud and Abuse: the waste that comes as fraudsters issue fake bills and run scams,28 and also from the blunt procedures of inspection and regulation that everyone faces because of the misbehaviors of a very few. We estimate that this category represented between $82 billion and $272 billion in wasteful spending in 2011.20,29

even in poor countries, the public sector provides higher quality care: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3378609/> Public sector provision was associated with higher rates of treatment success for tuberculosis and HIV [61]–[64] as well as vaccination [65],[66]. For example, in Pakistan, a matched cohort study in Karachi found that public sector tuberculosis care resulted in an 85% higher treatment success rate than private sector care [63]. In Thailand, patients seeking care in private institutions had significantly lower treatment success rates for tuberculosis, which was attributed to a three to five times greater likelihood of being prescribed non-WHO-recommended regimens than in the public sector [61]. In South Korea, tuberculosis treatment success rates were 51.8% in private clinics as opposed to 79.7% in public clinics, with only 26.2% of patients in private clinics receiving the recommended therapy, and over 40% receiving an inappropriately short duration of therapy [62]. Similarly higher rates of treatment failure were observed for private than public system patients on antiretroviral therapy for HIV in Botswana [64]. In India, an analysis of over 120,000 households, adjusted for demographic and socioeconomic factors, found that children receiving private health services were less likely to receive measles vaccinations [65]. Similar findings were reported from Cambodia [66].

42.4% of those with cancer lose their entire life savings in just 2 years: <https://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(18)30509-6/fulltext> Across 9.5 million estimated new diagnoses of cancer from 2000–2012, individuals averaged 68.6±9.4 years with slight majorities being married (54.7%), not retired (51.1%), and Medicare beneficiaries (56.6%). At year+2, 42.4% depleted their entire life's assets, with higher adjusted odds associated with worsening cancer, requirement of continued treatment, demographic and socioeconomic factors (ie, female, Medicaid, uninsured, retired, increasing age, income, and household size), and clinical characteristics (ie, current smoker, worse self-reported health, hypertension, diabetes, lung disease) (P<.05); average losses were $92,098.

# most medical practice is based on weak evidence

2007 book suggests that less than half of medical practice is evidence-based, reviewing 6 studies: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK64784/> Estimates range widely concerning the proportion of medical care in the United States that is based on, or supported by, adequate evidence [9-14]. However, given concerns about the extent to which this information may be generalized and the quality of the evidence that is used, some place this figure at well below half.

# solutions
establish regulatory bodies with the purpose of creating high-quality evidence and limiting un-evidenced treatments: <https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/12/28/16823266/medical-treatments-evidence-based-expensive-cost-stents> https://twitter.com/SocDoneLeft/status/1301560461238906881 """A proposal from the Hamilton Project would give the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) more resources to scrutinize medical technologies and allow the agency to experiment with “reference pricing”: Medicare would pay a single price for all treatments, for a given condition, that have similar therapeutic effects, up to a cost-effectiveness threshold. Patients who want to receive less cost-effective treatments could still get them, but they’d have to pay any difference out of pocket. That strikes the right balance."""

# construction cannot explain cost increases
construction cannot explain the rise in tuition: <https://www.demos.org/publication/pulling-higher-ed-ladder-myth-and-reality-crisis-college-affordability> To get an idea of the maximum impact that the additional borrowing could have on college costs, enrollment at the largest public institutions—approximating the 224 universities and university systems included in the Moody’s data—totaled 10.2 million in fall 2012.25 If all debt service costs were paid for by students, this would yield a figure of $367 per student in increased debt service costs over the past decade. [....] Though we can’t estimate an exact impact on tuition, if we fairly estimate that half of these costs are paid for by students, we find that increased borrowing to fund college construction could account for about 5 percent of the tuition increases over the past decade. Clearly, increased college construction costs are not a major cause of rising tuition.

# state loans cannot explain cost increases [unformatted, reread] (ancap talking point)
increased student aid doesn't correlate with increased tuition: <https://www.demos.org/publication/pulling-higher-ed-ladder-myth-and-reality-crisis-college-affordability> The claim that increased student aid causes tuition to rise was originated by William Bennett, the secretary of education under Ronald Reagan, in a 1987 New York Times opinion piece.19 Numerous academic studies since have tested the Bennett hypothesis, and though a few have found some link between rising aid and tuition in at most one sector of higher education,20 the vast majority have “…found not a shred of evidence of an empirical relationship,” as David Warren wrote in the Washington Post.21 As Warren notes, three major federal reports in the last fifteen years have each surveyed the existing academic literature, and each concluded that no such relationship exists. The most recent, conducted by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in 2011, took advantage of a unique “natural experiment” to test the Bennett hypothesis: the substantial increases in Stafford Loan limits between 2007 and 2009.22 In 2007, the yearly loan limits, adjusted for inflation, ranged from $2,925 for freshmen to $6,125 for upper classmen. By 2009, they had risen to $5,750 and $7,825, respectively. All told, the yearly borrowing limit for all undergraduates increased by an average of $2,340. However, average tuition at public 4-year universities rose by just $540 over the same two years, in line with recent historical averages, leading the GAO to reject the possibility of a relationship between the two. Additionally, these increases in borrowing limits were the first since 1993, meaning that the inflation-adjusted value of the limit had declined for more than a decade during which tuitions rose steadily. All told, both the empirical evidence and academic consensus deem the Bennett hypothesis false.

[....] The findings highlight the importance of recognizing endogeneity and the nontrivial performance challenges facing newly private enterprises in a framework with agency and expropriation costs. The tradeoff is most pronounced for enterprises that enjoyed subsidies prior to privatization. They experience negative effects for up to 10 years. In the long run, the effect becomes insignificant.
controlling for past performance, short-term performance of assets is worse after privatization for heavily subsidized and better after privatization for weakly subsidized public assets, but both converge to about equal performance after ~10 years: <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378426613001052> <http://sci-hub.se/10.1016/j.jbankfin.2013.02.017> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/643476490402529291/2013_Ownership_Change.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/643477004926320650/unknown.png """In cases of greater pre-privatization reliance on the government for subsidies and transfers prior to privatization, the short- and medium-run effects of privatization are negative, consistent with the newly private enterprises struggling to achieve profitability after subsidies are removed. However, the effect is mitigated in the long run as the necessary efficiency improvements are implemented. Thus, consistent with what one might expect, privatization effects grow weaker and become insignificant in the long run (10 years since the reform completion), corroborating the notion that the tradeoffs are felt more acutely in the short to medium term. With the passage of time, companies are able to leverage the incentive improvements associated with the switch to private ownership and compensate for the costs of restructuring. By comparison, in cases where the government did not subsidize heavily prior to privatization, newly privatized firms do not experience the adverse shock of subsidy reduction and instead appear to benefit right away from a switch to private ownership through privatization"""
public infrastructure investment produces longterm economic growth: <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00036849700000023> Annual data over 1970-90 for 48 developing countries form the basis of the empirical analysis. Our findings suggest that infrastructural public investment facilitates private investment, especially in the long-run. It also promotes economic growth and efficiency whereas non-infrastructural investment does the reverse. Also, long-term effects of public investment tend to be much more positive than short-term ones on growth.

While the response by government has not always been the same, the boom and bust cycle has continued. Some common causes for this cycle include inadequate regulation of the financial sector. Many of these aspects have carried over into the current financial crisis."""

# economic planning: theory on computation and efficiency
#####o
# theory: critiques
the two main critiques of central planning have been 'theoretical incomputability' (computing optimal resource allocation is mathematically impossible) and 'practical incomputability' (insufficient information or computation is available for this problem): <http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/socialism_book/calculation_debate.pdf> 

# theory: theoretical computability (economic calculation problem)
infite possible commodities does not imply uncomputability, as very few possible commodities have nonzero price, inputs, or outputs: <http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~greg/publications/ccm.IJUC07.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/565303895241392128/unknown.png
calculation of an input-output model has a time complexity of n*m*r: <http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/socialism_book/calculation_debate.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/574901351364952064/unknown.png
markets are efficient if and only if P = NP: <https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.2284> """I prove that if markets are weak-form efficient, meaning current prices fully reflect all information available in past prices, then P = NP, meaning every computational problem whose solution can be verified in polynomial time can also be solved in polynomial time. I also prove the converse by showing how we can “program” the market to solve NP-complete problems. Since P probably does not equal NP, markets are probably not efficient. Specifically, markets become increasingly inefficient as the time series lengthens or becomes more frequent."""

# theory: practical computability (economic calculation problem)
in practice, planning for economies of modern scale is easily computed even on home computers: <http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~greg/publications/ccm.IJUC07.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/565302380841926656/unknown.png
capitalism can be conceptualized as an iterative input-output model: <http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~greg/publications/ccm.IJUC07.pdf> Firms add up wage costs and costs of other commodity inputs, add a markup, and set their prices accordingly. This distributed algorithm, which is nowadays carried out by a combination of people and company computers, is structurally similar to the solution of linear equations by an iterative method. This models one phase of the iterative solution of Sraffa’s equations. Empirical evidence indicates that the price vector upon which the process converges lies somewhere near the vector of labour values see [29, 24].

# theory: natural resources
neither capitalism nor socialism properly 'prices in' finite resources: <http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/socialism_book/calculation_debate.pdf> Socialist planners “presumably would have to develop some kind of proxy for the value of nonreproducible resources in units of labour hours. It is difficult to imagine how this could be done in a way that would not be completely arbitrary.” We do not wish to deny there is a problem here. We do, however, find it rather remarkable that Mises (and his expositor, Lavoie) should talk as if the problem solves itself under capitalism. Neither offers any criticism of the classic Ricardian theory, according to which the market price system also fails to take into account non-reproducible resources. For Ricardo, natural resource constraints manifest themselves in the price system via rising marginal cost of production, i.e. just the effect which Mises takes to be inadequate. [....] In fact, matters are not infrequently worse under capitalism. The fact that a certain resource is ultimately exhaustible does not necessarily mean that it is subject to diminishing returns in the short run. In the westward expansion of American agriculture, for instance, the (geographically) marginal land was actually the most productive. In such cases the market provides no incentive whatever for resource conservation; the results were painfully evident in the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. We are not claiming that labour-time calculation would necessarily do better in cases where the market fails to conserve resources. We do contend, however, that socialist planners should be able to take more far-sighted decisions on resource conservation than profit-maximizing firms.

# theory: double marginalization
among soda bottling firms, vertical integration across double margins (eg, a bottler bottling both Coke and Pepsi was purchased by Coke and one "double margin" was eliminated) decreased prices: <http://www.law.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/searlecenter/events/antitrust/documents/Luco_Marshall_VISoda_Searle.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/574897295972106240/unknown.png We find that vertical integration decreased the prices of own brands bottled by a vertically-integrated bottler by 1.7 percent (e.g., Diet Pepsi bottled by PepsiCo) and it increased the prices of rival brands bottled by a vertically-integrated bottler by 3.9 percent (e.g., Dr Pepper bottled by PepsiCo). The overall impact of vertical integration was to increase the prices of products bottled by vertically-integrated bottlers by 1.6 percent. Dynamic effects estimates show that the price increases in products bottled by a vertically-integrated bottler only started after the vertical transactions took place, and the price increases persisted in time. These results suggest that vertical integration with multiproduct firms has the potential of harming consumers because of how the vertically-integrated multiproduct firms use rival-brand prices to divert demand to their (more profitable to sell) own brands.

# theory: nonhomogenous labor
the value of skilled labor may be calculated as the "labor price" required to produce said skilled labor: <http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/socialism_book/calculation_debate.pd> True, labour is not homogeneous, but there is no warrant for the claim that the reduction factor for complex labour has to be arbitrary under socialism. Skilled labour may be treated in the same way that Marx treats the means of production in Capital, namely as a produced input which ‘transfers’ embodied labour to its product over time. Given the labour time required to produce skills and a depreciation horizon for those skills, one may calculate an implied ‘rate of transfer’ of the labour time embodied in the skills. If we call this rate, for skill i, ri , then labour of this type should be counted as a multiple (1 + ri) of simple labour, for the purpose of ‘costing’ its products. Of course the labour input required for the production of skills is likely to be a mixture of skilled and simple, which complicates the calculation of the skill multipliers. An iterative procedure is needed: first calculate the transfer rates as if all inputs were simple labour, then use those first-round transfer rates to re-evaluate the skilled labour inputs, on this basis recompute the transfer rates, and so on, until convergence is reached.

# theory: labor vouchers
Marx 1875: under socialism ("lower phase of communism"), laborers ("individual producers") should receive labor vouchers based on time worked (after deduction "for the communal fund") and use them to pay for means of consumption: <https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/ch01.htm> <https://u1lib.org/book/2484971/053dce> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/865284162122285076/mecw24.pdf> """Accordingly, the individual producer receives back from society – after the deductions have been made – exactly what he gives to it. What he has given it is his individual quantum of labour. For instance, the social working day consists of the sum of the individual hours of work. The individual labour time of the individual producer thus constitutes his contribution to the social working day, his share of it. Society gives him a certificate stating that he has done such and such an amount of work (after the labour done for the communal fund has been deducted), and with this certificate he can withdraw from the social supply of means of consumption as much as costs an equivalent amount of labour."""
^ Marx 1875: justification for labor vouchers: <https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/ch01.htm> <https://u1lib.org/book/2484971/053dce> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/865284162122285076/mecw24.pdf> """Here, obviously, the same principle prevails as that which regulates the exchange of commodities, as far as this is exchange of equal values. Content and form are changed, because under the altered circumstances no one can give anything except his labor, and because, on the other hand, nothing can pass to the ownership of individuals, except individual means of consumption. But as far as the distribution of the latter among the individual producers is concerned, the same principle prevails as in the exchange of commodity equivalents: a given amount of labor in one form is exchanged for an equal amount of labor in another form."""
labor vouchers: <http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/socialism_book/calculation_debate.pdf> The labour certificates Marx talks of here are quite different from money. They do not circulate, rather they are cancelled against the acquisition of consumer goods of equivalent labour content. And they may be used for consumer goods alone; they cannot purchase means of production or labour power, and hence cannot function as capital.

It is conceivable that larger firms may tend to focus on innovations with a higher market value.

With about 700,000 practicing physicians in the US in 2004 [20], we estimate that with a total expenditure of US$57.5 billion, the industry spent around US$61,000 in promotion per physician. **As a percentage of US domestic sales of US$235.4 billion [21], promotion consumes 24.4% of the sales dollar versus 13.4% for R&D.**

# public sector efficient
public sector pharmaceutical research is 2x more likely to get primary review: <https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmsa1008268> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1056/nejmsa1008268> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/762496258970877962/stevens2011.pdf> The FDA assigns the application one of two types of review on the basis of its therapeutic potential: priority review if the drug shows substantial improvement, as compared with currently marketed products for the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a disease, or standard review if the drug appears to have therapeutic qualities similar to those of one or more drugs that are already on the market. [....] During this period, the FDA approved 1541 new-drug applications but granted priority review to just 348 applications (22.6%) (Table 2). **Of the 1541 total approvals, 143 (9.3%) resulted from PSRIs. However, of the 348 priority reviews, 66 (19.0%) resulted from PSRIs, or twice the overall rate for priority reviews. Viewed from another perspective, 46.2% of new-drug applications from PSRIs received priority reviews, as compared with 20.0% of applications that were based purely on private-sector research, an increase by a factor of 2.3.
^ drugs approved close to (within 2 months of) their Congress-mandated deadline had greater adverse effects (black-box warnings and safety-based withdrawls), but priority review products were not more likely to have adverse effects: <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00544.x> <http://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00544.x> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/634831533966098442/unknown.png To assess claims that lower-quality policy outcomes may arise from inherent drug uncertainty, we include two measures to capture agency uncertainty. One is an indicator of whether the FDA designated the drug for priority review, a designation reservedfor drugs that represent significant innovation over existing therapies. Such innovation holds potential for greater drug safety and efficacy but greater uncertainty as new formulations are introduced into the market for the first time. [....] There appears to be no stratification in the deadline effect across priority and nonpriority reviews, save for dosage-form discontinuations, where there is a deadline effect among standard drugs but not among priority drugs (see the online appendix, Tables A13a, b).
^ drugs approved close to (within 2 months of) their Congress-mandated deadline had greater adverse effects (disability, hospitalization, or death), and priority review products were more likely to have adverse effects: <https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/589934> <http://sci-hub.se/10.1086/589934> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/634830568017625099/unknown.png Initiation of the PDUFA requirements concentrated the number of approval decisions made in the weeks immediately preceding the deadlines. As compared with drugs approved at other times, drugs approved in the 2 months before their PDUFA deadlines were more likely to be withdrawn for safety reasons (odds ratio, 5.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3 to 27.8), more likely to carry a subsequent black-box warning (odds ratio, 4.4; 95% CI, 1.2 to 20.5), and more likely to have one or more dosage forms voluntarily discontinued by the manufacturer (odds ratio, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.5 to 7.5).
^ the FDA's priority review system is effective at categorizing drugs with high clinical added value: <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00228-016-2104-3> <http://sci-hub.se/10.1007/s00228-016-2104-3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/634838277718802454/unknown.png The Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS) is a French government agency that provides recommendations on reimbursement decisions of medicinal products made by the public authorities. Their decisions are based on a clinical added value (CAV) using a five-level scoring system that takes into account the comparative efficacy and safety data of a new drug with regards to available treatments[.] [....] The positive predictive value corresponded to the number of NME seen in shorter review time and highly clinical added value (i.e., true positive) among the total of shorter review time NME. The negative predictive value corresponded to the number of NME not seen in shorter review time and slightly clinical added value (i.e., true negative) among the total of non-shorter review time NME. [....] Secondly, among the 43 NME judged as of highly clinical added value by HAS, shorter review time was considered for 37 of them by the FDA compared to 13 of them by the EMA.

Cooperatives are low-profile but powerful economic actors, with the world's 300 largest ones generating revenues in 2008 of more than $1.6 trillion. [....] [T]he cooperative model is widespread and by at least one measure surpasses shareholder corporations: the 1 billion member-owners of cooperatives worldwide exceed the 893 million shareholders of corporations. The latter figure includes direct shareholders, who own stock as individuals, and indirect shareholders, who own stock through mutual funds and other indirect vehicles. If individual stockholders are considered alone, cooperative member-owners outnumber direct shareholders three to one. [....] In some advanced industrial countries, coops generate a meaningful share of economic output: 21% in Finland, 17.5% in New Zealand, 16.4% in Switzerland, and 13% in Sweden. [....] A 2010 World Bank report found that credit union branches account for 23 percent of bank branches worldwide and serve 870 million people, making them the second largest financial services network in the world. [....] Similarly for insurance: more than 30 percent of the market in the five largest insurance markets globally is controlled by mutual and coop firms.

By contrast, average values of output per log input (material productivity) are usually higher for the co-ops and the unionized mills and lowest for the classical mills. This implies quite different labor-log ratios as shown in the last line: computed over all production types, the average ratio of worker-hours to log inputs in cooperative and unionized mills is more than double its value in classical mills. These differences in input ratios are less marked in mills specializing in plywood and in veneer production. Output per size of largest lathe (XIK) is consistently highest among the unionized mills and usually lowest among the classical mills.""""""Craig and Pencavel conclude, "Worker participation has neither major efficiency gains nor efficiency losses." I found this conclusion rather bold given the imprecision of the estimates. Moreover, a 14 percent increase in productivity could be considered a major gain. To achieve this large a gain, one would have to increase logs by some 30 percent."""

# scarcity ("Why don't more exist?")
Olsen 2013 argues that "financing constraints" because of lender reluctance and lack of collateral and "elevated early risk" because firms are usually entirely worker-funded (ie, high liability) cause cooperatives to be formed less than conventional enterprises: <https://community-wealth.org/sites/clone.community-wealth.org/files/downloads/article-olsen.pdf> 
Abell 2014 argues that "culture" (the cultural dominance of conventional capitalist enterprise), "business expertise" (the lack of worker experience in business management), "financing" (lack of startup funding), "management" and "organizational democracy" (the need to build an egalitarian, democratic decisionmaking style in order for the enterprise to succeed) are the main barriers to entry for cooperatives: <https://community-wealth.org/sites/clone.community-wealth.org/files/downloads/WorkerCoops-PathwaysToScale.pdf>

right to work laws directly increase occupational deaths: <https://oem.bmj.com/content/early/2018/06/13/oemed-2017-104747> Methods Two-way fixed effects regression models are used to estimate the effect of unionisation on occupational mortality per 100 000 workers, controlling for state policy liberalism and workforce composition over the period 1992–2016. In the final specification, RTW laws are used as an instrument for unionisation to recover causal effects. Results The Local Average Treatment Effect of a 1% decline in unionisation attributable to RTW is about a 5% increase in the rate of occupational fatalities. In total, RTW laws have led to a 14.2% increase in occupational mortality through decreased unionisation.

In countries with robust EPL, unemployment scarring is largely insensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions. By contrast, in countries with weaker EPL, unemployment scarring is cyclical and becomes larger as macroeconomic conditions deteriorate.

(2012), $30,000 in Suárez Serrato and Wingender (2011), and $35,000 in Shoag (2010).32 My estimates for the impact of tax cuts for the top 10 percent on employment are statistically and economically indistinguishable from zero, so the corresponding cost-per-job estimate is much higher. Therefore, given my estimates by income group, the overall impact of a tax cut of 1 percent of GDP that goes half to the bottom 90 percent and half to the top 10 percent will have roughly a $63,000 cost per job."""

Since then, offshore deposits by nonbanks nearly doubled from 2004 to December 2007, when the global economy took a tumble. During that period, offshore financial assets may have grown to be worth as much as $22 to 33 trillion. Since then the model indicates that they have slumped slightly to the $21 trillion to $32 trillion range, with a plausible midpoint of about $26 trillion.  But this still represents enough growth since 2004 to be consistent with the growth in global private banking AUMs noted above. Assuming a developing country wealth share of 25 to 30 percent, this range is also consistent with the results of our accumulated wealth model."""

Spain abolished its wealth tax on January 1, 2009, but then re-introduced it in 2012. Austria and Denmark discontinued their wealth tax in 1995, Germany in 1997, Finland and Luxembourg in 2006, and Sweden in 2007.

One can think of the backlash on taxes in general that began with Reagan and Thatcher in the 1980s. This was followed by a conservative backlash in continental Europe in the 1990s and 2000s. For example, the conservative government elected to power in Sweden in the mid-2000s engineered the elimination of both the direct wealth tax and the inheritance tax."""

The first reason is that wealth taxes have failed in Europe. Indeed, eight of the twelve European countries with a wealth tax in 1990 had abandoned them by 2019.  Saez and Zucman argue that the wealth tax repeals in Europe were the result of poor policy choices. For example, European wealth taxes were levied on households with little cash but substantial illiquid wealth due to low exemption thresholds. To avoid this problem, Saez and Zucman advocate for a high exemption threshold. The authors note that the exemption threshold in Elizabeth Warren’s wealth tax proposal—which is set at $50 million—is 50 times higher than the typical European wealth tax."""

As shown for example by Johannesen and Zucman (2014), half hearted tax enforcement efforts can be easily circumvented and end up having minimal effects on tax evasion. In contrast, the US has taken a bold step in the enforcement direction with FACTA in 2010 that imposes steep penalties on foreign financial institutions that fail to report accounts of US residents to the US tax authorities (see Zucman, 2015 for a detailed discussion).""""""FATCA follows the route of policing directly foreign financial institutions but with the difficulty that the US tax authorities have less power to audit effectively foreign financial institutions than home financial institutions. Another route is to get foreign governments to share the information they can collect from their financial institutions.

The EU is organized to foster such tax competition. Individual income and wealth taxation depends solely on current residence. Hence, when France had a progressive wealth tax before 2018, moving from Paris to London would extinguish immediately progressive wealth tax liability (except for domestic real estate assets).""""""What is more, EU countries have schemes to lure away the high skill or the wealthy from their home countries by promising tax breaks to movers. Contrast this with US policy: US citizens remain liable for US income taxes for life and regardless of residence (but with full credit for foreign income taxes paid). The only way to escape the US income tax is to renounce US citizenship and even then, the US imposes a substantial exit tax. The exit tax, formally known as the expatriation tax, is essentially a tax on all unrealized capital gains upon expatriation. It applies to high income (incomes over $160,000) or high wealth (wealth above $2 million) expatriates. It applies to citizens who renounce citizenship and also to long-term residents who end their US resident tax status. The wealth tax proposal by Elizabeth Warren proposes to further strengthen the exit with a 40% wealth tax on expatriates’ assets.

Hayek developed a unique theory of the business cycle. In their view, an unsustainable boom ensues when the rate of interest prevailing in the market falls below the natural rate. Mistaking the easy credit for a genuine increase in savings, entrepreneurs are led to take on more capital-intensive projects. According to the Austrians, the boom is characterized not only by an increase in aggregate production but also by a distortion of the structure of production. Once the errors are realized, a recession follows: aggregate production declines as the structure of production is repaired."""

# structural analysis: young 2012
Kuehn 2013: reviewing Young 2012 <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08913811.2013.853863> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1080/08913811.2013.853863> The most sophisticated empirical research on Hayekian business-cycle theory to date is offered by Andrew Young (2012), who develops a measure of the length of the capital structure rather than relying on qualitative industrial or process classifications. He estimates the position of an industry in the capital structure with the total industry output requirement (TIOR), or the gross value of all other industries’ output required by an industry to generate one dollar’s worth of that industry’s final good. Industries that fall relatively early in the capital structure will use fewer inputs to produce their (gross) output, and so they will have a lower measured TIOR. Using this method, Young (2012) calculates the TIOR for sixty-five industries, and determines that the aggregated length of the capital structure measured using his methods is pro-cyclical and closely correlated with the federal funds rate from 1998 to 2009, as Hayekian theory suggests. One problem with this measure that Young (2012) points out is that it is not clear how much meaning can be ascribed to a given change in the TIOR. From 2008 to 2009, the aggregate TIOR fell from about 1.8 to a little over 1.7. Is this a large change or a small one? Does it matter for macroeconomic fluctuations? At this point, it is difficult to say. If nothing else, the empirical work suggests that Kaldor (1942, 363) was quite wrong in dismissing the lengthening of the structure of production as “one of those blind alleys of economic speculation which appear very suggestive for a time, but whose significance evaporates as soon as one tries to fit the theoretical conclusions more closely to the observed phenomena.” The theoretical discussion fits the best analyses of the observed phenomena quite well. Questions remain, however, about the strength of the Hayekian mechanisms or their significance for the business cycle.

# empirics: recession size should predict growth size (it doesn't)

[....] A correlation between the depth of a recession and the height of the subsequent boom would strongly imply that recessions are the consequence of a shock that had nothing to do with the preceding growth period, and that the recovery was just a reversion of the economy back to its stable growth path. Friedman found that in a data series going back to the late nineteenth century recession depths were correlated with the subsequent boom and not the prior boom. He called this the “plucking model” because it implied that recessions were caused by plucking the economy down from an otherwise steady growth path. In many ways, Friedman’s simple empirical exercise offers the greatest blow to Hayek of all the criticisms discussed here. A theory of the unsustainable boom is of little use if busts are not caused by booms."""

# empirics: monetary policy should predict recessions (it doesn't)
Kuehn 2013: Hayekian theory poorly predicts recessions; neither tight or loose monetary policy, relative to the "natural" rate of interest, consistently precedes or postcedes recessions: <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08913811.2013.853863> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1080/08913811.2013.853863> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/553974446269136914/unknown.png Figure 2, below, subtracts the real federal funds rate from this estimated natural rate. If this difference is equal to zero, then the actual federal funds rate set by the Federal Reserve is equal to the best estimate of the natural rate of interest, and monetary policy is neutral. A positive value for the difference indicates tight monetary policy, while a negative value indicates loose monetary policy. Vertical lines are provided to indicate the start date of recessions, as determined by the National Bureau of Economic Research. [....] The recessions of the 1960s and 1970s at least have the virtue of exhibiting the pro-cyclical (albeit persistently loose) monetary stance required by Hayek. Far less is available for Austrians to work with in the case of the 1981-82 and 1990-91 recessions, which were not preceded by any monetary loosening at all. Regardless of the actual level of the real interest rate, if this rate is not below the natural rate – if monetary policy is not expansionary – there can be no unsustainable boom according to Hayekian business cycle theory. [....] Hayekians who think that the capital structure lengthens and contracts with the price signals sent by monetary policy are confronted with an awkward question: exactly what were entrepreneurs doing between 2005-06 and 2008? [....] Given the weak evidence for Hayek’s unsustainable boom, it seems far more plausible that Keynesian (or monetarist) forces drive the business cycle, and that the capital structure – behaving in an otherwise purely Hayekian manner – lengthens and contracts as a consequence the of the business cycle, rather than as its cause.

# empirics: relative intermediate prices should decrease (they don't)
Luther 2014: ABCT predicts that an increase in interest rates should cause crude and finished goods to increase in both quantity and price relative to intermediate goods: for both price and quantity and crude and finished goods, empirical results are statistically insignificant and opposite in sign to these predictions: <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11293-014-9415-5> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1007/s11293-014-9415-5> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/725726136402706442/luther2014.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/553983169938849793/unknown.png """If the Austrian view is empirically relevant, the authors surmise, a positive monetary shock should increase the production and prices of goods at early and late stages relative to the production and prices of goods at middle stages.""""""With the exception of early- to middle-stage prices, which responded positively to the productivity gap but negatively to TGt, the responses depicted in Figs. 1 and 2 are qualitatively similar. For the most part, the responses of the four ratios are small, statistically insignificant, and of the opposite sign as that predicted by the Austrian theory. From this, we conclude that our results are robust to selection of a measure of the natural rate and, accordingly, are more confident in our assessment that the available data provides little empirical support for the Austrian business cycle theory.

# empirics: investment should go down when consumption goes up (it's the opposite)
Hayekian theory predicts that consumption and investment move oppositely; they move together: <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08913811.2013.853863> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1080/08913811.2013.853863> Cowen (1997) points out that over the business cycle, investment and consumption move together, a phenomenon he refers to as “co-movement”. [...] Hayek’s theory predicts that investment and consumption should move in opposite directions over the business cycle[.] [...] First, Prices and Production assumed that the economy starts in a position of full employment before the unsustainable boom begins. [...] [S]ince the economy is operating at capacity any increase in capital goods production has to come at the expense of consumer goods production. [...] [Second,] the upper-turning point [...] accounts for the end of the boom with the Ricardian assumption that capital intensification occurs at the expense of labor income, and that this tension between capital and labor ends the boom. [....] Garrison (2000, 2004) provides a supply-side response by assuming that capital intensive production processes are more productive than labor intensive production processes, so the move to capital intensive processes can accommodate a simultaneous increase in consumption and investment. [....] Hayek clearly expected a movement of consumption and investment in opposite directions: “an increase in the demand for consumer goods will tend to decrease rather than increase the demand for investment goods” [...] [I]f Garrison [...] is accurate, it is not clear what needs to be rebalanced in a market correction (i.e., a recession). [...] [T]he upper turning point occurred precisely because of this tension between consumption and investment. If that tension is explained away [...] then [...] the inevitable bust is explained away as well.

# empirics: businesses should vary daily behavior with interest rates (they don't)
Hayekian theory ignores the fact that businesses largely ignore the interest rate for day-to-day operations: <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08913811.2013.853863> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1080/08913811.2013.853863> A more substantial rebuttal to Hayek’s concerns about a distorted capital structure is offered by Tullock (1987), who objects to the whole idea that firms care much about interest rates in determining the volume of production. Hayek’s theory requires that an artificially low interest rate makes production that takes a longer time more profitable than it otherwise would be, but if interest costs are not even considered by firms the whole theory falls apart. [....] He further noted that the reason why firms ignore interest rates in production decisions is that even highly capital intensive production processes (after all capital equipment has been acquired and installed) do not usually take a substantial amount of time to complete. Tullock’s experience with interest rates anticipates a finding by Akerlof, Dickens, and Perry (2000) that as long as inflation is modest, firms ignore it in their decision making. Although entrepreneurial responses to interest rate variations (in Tullock’s case) or low inflation (in Akerlof, Dickens, and Perry’s case) need not be identical, the common conclusion of this and other behavioral research seems to be that these sorts of minor costs are discounted in the decision making process relative to larger concerns. If interest rates and inflation fail to drive distortionary production decisions it is hard to see why a market correction would be inevitable or even necessary. Interest rates are still critical for large capital expenditures, but the widely cited empirical work of Davis, Haltiwanger, and Schuh (1996) suggests that most job creation and destruction happens at large, mature establishments which are presumably primarily making capacity utilization decisions rather than new capital expenditure decisions.

Facts, statistical or other evidence cannot, he argued, be used to test those conclusions, but only to illustrate a theory. They cannot be used to contradict a theory, because we are not generalizing from observed evidence, but from innate knowledge of human motives and behavior.

Praxeology is a theoretical and systematic, not a historical, science. Its scope is human action as such, irrespective of all environmental, accidental, and individual circumstances of the concrete acts. Its cognition is purely formal and general without reference to the material content and the particular features of the actual case. It aims at knowledge valid for all instances in which the conditions exactly correspond to those implied in its assumptions and inferences. Its statements and propositions are not derived from experience. They are, like those of logic and mathematics, a priori. They are not subject to verification or falsification on the ground of experience and facts. They are both logically and temporally antecedent to any comprehension of historical facts. They are a necessary requirement of any intellectual grasp of historical events. Without them we should not be able to see in the course of events anything else than kaleidoscopic change and chaotic muddle."""

# Mises quote: rejecting actual empirical testing
Mises famously rejected statistical measures of economic performance in general: <https://mises.org/library/human-action-0/html/pp/730> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/782272708162748417/mises1963.pdf> """In the field of praxeology and economics no sense can be given to the notion of measurement. In the hypothetical state of rigid conditions there are no changes to be measured. In the actual world of change there are no fixed points, dimensions, or relations which could serve as a standard. The monetary unit's purchasing power never changes evenly with regard to all things vendible and purchasable. The notions of stability and stabilization are empty if they do not refer to a state of rigidity and its preservation. However, this state of rigidity cannot even be thought out consistently to its ultimate logical consequences; still less can it be realized."""
Mises rejected statistical measures of macroeconomic performance in specific: <https://mises.org/library/human-action-0/html/pp/730> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/782272708162748417/mises1963.pdf> """The pretentious solemnity which statisticians and statistical bureaus display in computing indexes of purchasing power and cost of living is out of place.

In periods of inflation and consequently of sharp price changes they provide a rough image of events which every individual experiences in his daily life. A judicious housewife knows much more about price changes as far as they affect her own household than the statistical averages can tell. She has little use for computations disregarding changes both in quality and in the amount of goods which she is able or permitted to buy at the prices entering into the computation. If she "measures" the changes for her personal appreciation by taking the prices of only two or three commodities as a yardstick, she is no less "scientific" and no more arbitrary than the sophisticated mathematicians in choosing their methods for the manipulation of the data of the market."""

# Murphy, Barnett, and Block 2010 quote: economic theory is geometry!
Murphy, Barnett, Block 2010a claim that praxeology is akin to geometry and cannot be tested: <http://www.academia.edu/download/8456307/5058young-22.doc> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/725731680664682637/murphy2010.pdf>"""For the Austrian economist, the most fundamental problem we encounter is that apodictic economic theories cannot be empirically tested at all. Rather, they are aspects of praxeology, and, as such, can only be illustrated, not tested. For praxeologists, economic theories are equivalent to mathematical or geometrical claims, such as the Pythagorean Theorem, or to the assertion that the three angles of a triangle sum to 180 degrees. One can indeed illustrate such declarations, but it would be meaningless to even attempt to test them. Young in this regard points to the “unwillingness of the ‘Austrian school’ to pursue econometrics.”  But Austrians are by no means “unwilling” to pursue econometrics; there are numerous praxeological publications that utilize such statistical techniques. All of them, however, illustrate, but do not purport to test, economic law."""
Young's response explains that even if Austrian logical claims follow qualitatively, they cannot explain magnitude quantitatively: <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11138-010-0126-0> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1007%2Fs11138-010-0126-0> """I never claim that the results in Young (2005) reject ABCT qualitatively.

However, I additionally claim that the “results suggest that Hayek’s theory [is] operative but lack[s] economic significance” (p. 275). Concluding that ABCT is not associated with economically significant effects (i.e., does not account for a large portion of reallocation’s variance) is a statement outside of the realm of pure theory.""""""Once it is accepted that quantitative, economic importance is something that pure theory can not speak to directly, quibbling about whether econometrics (or economic history) is testing or illustrating is an unfruitful exercise in semantics."""

The rate of growth in aggregate prices over time, then, would equal that growth necessary to be consistent with this Austrian proposition. If Bosh's 1.1 point adjustment to the CPI leads to wage growth exceeding productivity change, while no adjustment leads to productivity changes exceeding wage growth, the correct adjustment is one that equates these two measures, perhaps 0.5 or 0.7 percentage points."""
Vedder 1997 claims that free markets are by definition economically efficient; therefore, measuring them isn't worth the time: <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02538485> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1007/BF02538485> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/782295071520718848/vedder1997.pdf> """Even accepting the dominant method of modern economics, and believing that the use of empirical means to verify or falsify economic hypotheses is valid, the reality of data aggregation problems makes empirical exercises a hazardous and often dubious enterprise. On basic theoretical grounds, the problems of generalizing with any precision about the magnitude of price changes are substantial. In Rothbard's (1993) "evenly rotating economy" with freely operating market forces, the issue of aggregate economic performance is one that is either irrelevant or of a second order of importance. If economic agents are freely expressing their economic will in their decision making, the existing level of economic performance is optimal, and whether it is larger or smaller than in other time periods is not very important."""

# ethical child starvation
Rothbard's ethical framework explicitly allows for parents to starve their children: <https://mises.org/library/children-and-rights> <https://u1lib.org/book/1670179/9283e5> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/782293106594152490/rothbard1998.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/885694502877163540/unknown.png """As a corollary this means that, in the free society, no man may be saddled with the legal obligation to do anything for another, since that would invade the former's rights; the only legal obligation one man has to another is to respect the other man's rights. Applying our theory to parents and children, this means that a parent does not have the right to aggress against his children, but also that the parent should not have a legal obligation to feed, clothe, or educate his children, since such obligations would entail positive acts coerced upon the parent and depriving the parent of his rights. The parent therefore may not murder or mutilate his child, and the law properly outlaws a parent from doing so. But the parent should have the legal right not to feed the child, i.e., to allow it to die."""

# runaway freedom
Rothbard's ethical framework grants ownership of children to its parents; children gain legal autonomy only once they run away from their parent's home: <https://mises.org/library/children-and-rights> <https://u1lib.org/book/1670179/9283e5> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/782293106594152490/rothbard1998.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/885694764589137970/unknown.png """The mother, then, becomes at the birth of her child its "trustee-owner," legally obliged only not to aggress against the child's person, since the child possesses the potential for self-ownership. Apart from that, so long as the child lives at home, it must necessarily come under the jurisdiction of its parents, since it is living on property owned by those parents. Certainly the parents have the right to set down rules for the use of their home and property for all persons (whether children or not) living in that home. But when are we to say that this parental trustee jurisdiction over children shall come to an end? Surely any particular age (21,18, or whatever) can only be completely arbitrary. The clue to the solution of this thorny question lies in the parental property rights in their home. For the child has his full rights of self-ownership when he demonstrates that he has them in nature — in short, when he leaves or "runs away" from home. Regardless of his age, we must grant to every child the absolute right to run away and to find new foster parents who will voluntarily adopt him, or to try to exist on his own. Parents may try to persuade the runaway child to return, but it is totally impermissible enslavement and an aggression upon his right of self-ownership for them to use force to compel him to return. The absolute right to run away is the child's ultimate expression of his right of self-ownership, regardless of age."""

# free baby market
Rothbard therefore proposes that parents may freely trade their children: <https://mises.org/library/children-and-rights> <https://u1lib.org/book/1670179/9283e5> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/782293106594152490/rothbard1998.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/885695085898006559/unknown.png """Now if a parent may own his child (within the framework of non-aggression and runaway freedom), then he may also transfer that ownership to someone else. He may give the child out for adoption, or he may sell the rights to the child in a voluntary contract. In short, we must face the fact that the purely free society will have a flourishing free market in children. Superficially, this sounds monstrous and inhuman. But closer thought will reveal the superior humanism of such a market. For we must realize that there is a market for children now, but that since the government prohibits sale of children at a price, the parents may now only give their children away to a licensed adoption agency free of charge.10 This means that we now indeed have a child-market, but that the government enforces a maximum price control of zero, and restricts the market to a few privileged and therefore monopolistic agencies. The result has been a typical market where the price of the commodity is held by government far below the free-market price: an enormous "shortage" of the good. The demand for babies and children is usually far greater than the supply, and hence we see daily tragedies of adults denied the joys of adopting children by prying and tyrannical adoption agencies. In fact, we find a large unsatisfied demand by adults and couples for children, along with a large number of surplus and unwanted babies neglected or maltreated by their parents. Allowing a free market in children would eliminate this imbalance, and would allow for an allocation of babies and children away from parents who dislike or do not care for their children, and toward foster parents who deeply desire such children. Everyone involved: the natural parents, the children, and the foster parents purchasing the children, would be better off in this sort of society.11"""

# summary of personal finance self-help
Olen 2012: why self-help financial advice has taken off with little critique: <https://u1lib.org/dl/2167556/aa02b0?convertedTo=pdf> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/805901035691835492/olen2012.pdf> """By 1999, financial services advertising would be responsible for almost a third of newspaper ad monies, though how these dollars were distributed through the media universe would shift as the Internet assumed increasing prominence. In 2002, financial advertising would total $5.9 billion, rising to $8.8 billion in 2010, and just under $9.1 billion in 2011. In fact, Nielsen found that the top increases in promotional spending by category for the first part of 2011 were in automobile insurance, bank services, and financial investment services—all financially oriented categories. So, instead of freeing publishers and station managers from the tyranny of complaints from the auto, real estate, and retail industries, the emphasis on personal finance ultimately created yet another powerful advertising client base that would need to be appeased. As a result, it became increasingly difficult to rock the boat by questioning the assumptions behind much of the financial information presented, rendering much of the advice glib at best and suspect at worst."""

# asymmetric information in insurance markets
insurance markets with asymmetric information and two types of consumers (high-risk and low-risk) result in an externality in which low-risk consumers under-purchase insurance: <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780122148507500243> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1016/B978-0-12-214850-7.50024-3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/738068647934820355/unknown.png

mixed results: <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jori.12145> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/jori.12145> Dardanoni, Forcina and Donni (2016) found mixed results. Their sample was 2286 seniors from the 2002 Health and Retirement Study. Using the PC test, they found strong evidence for asymmetric information (and adverse selection) in favor of the purchase of Medigap plans. (Riskier individuals bought more coverage.) However, using their multivariate PC model, they found that this correlation varied significantly across personal demographics. For example, they found that people with higher cognitive abilities were more likely to purchase Medigap plans but less likely to use the hospital than their peers. This suggests that people with higher cognitive abilities are advantageously selecting into the plan: even those who don’t “need” the insurance (as much as their peers) are buying into it.

Their sample was 92725 people from a survey conducted by JD Power and Associates about insurance plans. Using the simple PC model, Sirmans found a strong negative correlation between risk and deductibles size (higher risk – smaller deductibles) and strong positive correlation between risk and premium (higher risk – higher premiums). Both of these suggest that adverse selection is occurring. Interestingly, they found no evidence that the proportion of people in a state in a group insurance plan -- which should reduce adverse selection -- was associated with adverse selection.

summary: Racialism, "scientific racism", and "race realism" describe the belief that human population groups have large, socially-important differences in phenotypes caused by differences in frequencies of genes. Scientific consensus and scientific evidence support scientific anti-racism, the position that genetic differences cause few socially-important differences between human populations.

note: genetics, intelligence, and violence are complicated topics. for an excellent long-form introduction for laypeople, see Rutherford 2020: How To Argue With A Racist, in which a geneticist reviews the arguments for scientific anti-racism: <https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1228315214> <https://u1lib.org/book/5406846/1a86f7> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/736771760371793940/rutherford2020.pdf>

Although there are clear observable correlations between variation in the human genome and how individuals identify by race, the study of human genetics challenges the traditional concept of different races of humans as biologically separate and distinct. This is validated by many decades of research, including recent examples. Most human genetic variation is distributed as a gradient, so distinct boundaries between population groups cannot be accurately assigned. There is considerable genetic overlap among members of different populations. Such patterns of genome variation are explained by patterns of migration and mixing of different populations throughout human history. In this way, genetics exposes the concept of “racial purity” as scientifically meaningless.

# lack of censorship
it is not taboo to study race and genetics; for example, the NIH extensively funds research examining the link between race, genetics, and health: <https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/voices/racial-differences-in-addiction-and-other-disorders-arent-mostly-genetic/> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/982325399210045600/unknown.png In the most recent NIH Biennial Report to Congress, for example, the words “genomic,” “genome,” and “genetic” are used a total of 556 times. In comparison, other words such as “social determinants of health,” “discrimination,” “poverty,” “socioeconomic status,” “racism,” and “sexism” appeared a total of 15 times in the entirety of the report’s 441 pages. In the decade between 1994 and 2005, the NIH funded 22,000 studies investigating genomics, 1,300 of which discussed race, genes and disease. The number of grants awarded to research the connection between health, racism and racial discrimination? Only 44.

Only six of the 53 statements reflect undecided perspectives or lack of general consensus among professional anthropologists (including, e.g., whether race influences health and whether genetic ancestry testing undermines biological conceptions of race). **Fourteen statements evoked unified responses from a super-majority, with professional anthropologists (a) rejecting the idea that humans can be subdivided into biological races; [rejecting] the idea that races are biologically determined; [rejecting] the existence of discrete boundaries among races;** and [rejecting] the use of genetic ancestry when making child placement or college admission decisions and (b) accepting the existence of biological variation; overlapping trait distributions; **[accepting] the superiority of genetic ancestry over race as a proxy for genetic relationships between peoples;** [accepting] the importance of understanding the relationship among race, genetics and health; and [accepting] the need to take genetic ancestry into account when diagnosing and treating certain conditions. Informal analysis of the data did not reveal any noticeable differences in perspectives between subfields.

Obviously, this does not imply that genetic discontinuities do not exist on a more local scale, for example, between people from different linguistic groups (e.g., Barbujani and Sokal 1990; Sokal et al. 1990). It also does not mean that no differences whatsoever exist between continental groups. In fact, what Rosenberg et al. (2002) have shown is that given enough markers and the extraordinary power of Structure, the tiny amounts of genetic differences that exist between continents can also be discerned. However, this should not obscure the fact that on a worldwide scale, clines are a better representation of the human diversity than clades, and that continents do not represent more substantial discontinuities in such clines than many other geographical and cultural barriers.

2010 review: humans have a low F_st value: <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168952510000788> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/541320761307168768/unknown.png More recent work suggests that the human species’ FST could actually be lower, between 0.05 and 0.13 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 for autosomal SNPs (Table 1), in other words between one-third and one-half of that observed in gorilla (Gorilla gorilla; FST = 0.38 [28]) and between Western and Eastern chimpanzee (FST = 0.32 [15]) despite humans occupying a much broader geographic area [29]. In short, not only do humans show the lowest species diversity among primates [30] but are also subdivided into populations that are more closely related than any other primate species, with the possible exception of bonobos (Pan paniscus) [18]. [....] The limited degree of differentiation among human populations does not suggest a history of long-term isolation and differentiation, but rather that genome variation was mostly shaped by our comparatively recent origin from a small number of founders 32, 33 who dispersed to colonize the whole planet 34, 35.
isolation by distance explains most human variation: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4756148/> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/564359627832033311/unknown.png [T]he emerging scientific consensus is that while isolation by distance explained a large proportion of human population pair-wise Fst-values, cluster, the computational placeholder for race, explained <2% (Rosenberg et al., 2005; Handley et al., 2007). Thus, the indistinctiveness Fst-value argument, as construed here against the idea of biological reality of human races, is not simply about crude Fst measures. It also takes into consideration the part of Fst quantitatively explained by cluster/race (Table ​(Table2).2). So it goes beyond Wright's qualitative guideline about the use of Fst. The argument thus has two quantitative components, the unadjusted Fst-values and the adjusted values of cluster/race covariate. It can thus be considered the quantitative equivalent of the qualitative argument of “lack of distinction” Darwin used to question the taxonomic wisdom of categorizing humans into races in natural classification since the categories cannot be objectively defined (Maglo, 2011).

categorization based on ancestry outperforms categorization based on race: <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-01837-7> Our findings indicate that ancestry cross-classifies ethno-linguistic group as well as continent and race. To expound this point, Western Asian ancestry currently exists at its highest frequency in peoples from the Caucasus Mountains and the Levant and is the major ancestry in Abkhazian, Georgian, and Druze samples. Yet, significant amounts of Western Asian ancestry are present in samples with origins ranging from Morocco to Mongolia and from England to Ethiopia. That is, Western Asian ancestry simultaneously exists in Africa, Asia, and Europe, as well as in the US racial categories Black or African American, Asian, and White. Thus, in contrast to race, ancestry is a valid genomic classifier.

Bailey 2009: the main driver of historical human brain size growth was social competition, not climate; temperate climates had the largest human brain sizes: <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12110-008-9054-0> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1007/s12110-008-9054-0> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/885248198027935744/bailey2009.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/507656640053641216/unknown.png We provide a multivariate analysis that enables the simultaneous assessment of variables representing each of these potential selective forces. Data were collated for latitude, prevalence of harmful parasites, mean annual temperature, and variation in annual temperature for the location of 175 hominid crania dating from 1.9 million to 10 thousand years ago. We also included a proxy for population density and two indexes of paleoclimatic variability for the time at which each cranium was discovered. Results revealed independent contributions of population density, variation in paleoclimate, and temperature variation to the prediction of change in hominid cranial capacity (CC). **Although the effects of paleoclimatic variability and temperature variation provide support for climatic hypotheses, the proxy for population density predicted more unique variance in CC than all other variables. The pattern suggests multiple pressures drove hominid brain evolution and that the core selective force was social competition.** [....] The third panel shows a similar relationship between temperature variation and CC; as temperature variation increases to the mean of this variable, CC increases. However, at approximately 0.5 SD from the mean or higher, increases in temperature variation are associated with decreases in CC. The amplitude of this function is less than 200 cm3.

metastudy: no decline: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4152423/> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1037/a0037173> However, although we cannot directly address cohort effects in this meta-analysis, we note that the magnitude of increases in Wechsler and SB scores has remained close to the nominal value of 3 IQ points per decade since 1984 (Flynn, 2009a).

This implies that the trends are not due to a changing composition of families, and that there is at most a minor role for explanations involving genes (e.g., immigration and dysgenic fertility) and environmental factors largely fixed within families (e.g., parental education, socialization effects of low-ability parents, and family size). While such factors may be present, their influence is negligible compared with other environmental factors. Notably, this goes counter to the conclusion of a recent review on retrograde Flynn effects (6) and the expert opinions reported in a recent survey of intelligence researchers, which found “the anti-Flynn effect being attributed mainly to genetics and immigration” (7). As noted by two of the reviewers, the magnitude of the negative Flynn trend in our data itself speaks against the dysgenic hypothesis for retrograde Flynn effects, as changes in IQ over time are too large to plausibly reflect selection-driven genetic change in the population.""""""Polygenic scores that predict education are correlated with IQ and have been shown to correlate negatively with fertility in Icelandic and US data (16, 17). The authors of the Icelandic study extrapolate that their results imply a decline of 0.30 IQ point per decade, an effect sufficiently small to fall within the uncertainty bounds of the difference between across- and within-family trend estimates in the present study."""

this appears to be mainly an effect of lags from computerized testing and from increased average age: <https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2015.00131/full> <https://sci-hub.se/10.3389/fnhum.2015.00131> """For example, in studies performed from 1884 to 1893, Francis Galton recorded visual SRT latencies that ranged from 181 to 189 ms in subjects ranging in age from 18 to 60 years (Johnson et al., 1985). These latencies are considerably shorter than those reported in recent SRT studies (Lowe and Rabbitt, 1998; Deary et al., 2001; Deary and Der, 2005; Der and Deary, 2006). Given the correlation between SRTs and fluid intelligence (Deary et al., 2001; Bugg et al., 2006), Woodley et al. (2013) concluded that the slowed SRTs in recent studies reflected a systematic reduction in processing speed, and hence fluid intelligence, in contemporary populations. However, an alternative explanation of the apparent SRT slowing is that the SRT latencies reported in recent studies have been inflated by hardware and software delays in computerbased paradigms (Dordonova and Dordonov, 2013). In support of this argument, contemporary studies using mechanical SRT measurements (Montare, 2010; Eckner et al., 2011), including SRT testing procedures similar to those used by Galton (Dordonova and Dordonov, 2013), report SRT latencies similar to those observed in the Victorian era."""

in a sample of 1881 bostonians, there were no racial differences in testosterone among black, white, and Hispanic people: <https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/91/11/4326/2656429> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/542051741018095636/zeg0110646170001.png With or without adjustment for covariates, there were no significant differences in testosterone, bioavailable testosterone, or SHBG levels by race/ethnicity. DHEAS levels differed by race/ethnicity before covariate adjustment; after adjustment this difference was attenuated. Before adjustment, DHT and DHT to testosterone ratios did not significantly differ by racial/ethnic group. After adjustment, there was evidence of racial/ethnic differences in DHT (P = 0.047) and DHT to testosterone (P = 0.038) levels. Black men had higher DHT levels and DHT to testosterone ratios than white and Hispanic men.
in a sample of 280, race did not affect testosterone or risk-taking: <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306453015002024> Because of our predominantly Caucasian samples, any effects of racial differences in testosterone would have to be extremely large to systematically influence our results. Nevertheless, we did examine if differences between Caucasians and non-Caucasians existed for cortisol, testosterone, and our risk-taking measures in each study, but none were found (ps ≥ .380). Furthermore, controlling for whether participants were Caucasian did not alter the significance of our reported Testosterone × Cortisol interactions (ps ≤ .040), and moderated regression analysis testing 3-way Race × Testosterone × Cortisol interactions revealed that Caucasian status did not moderate our reported dual-hormone interactions (ps ≥ .307).

However, black men had the highest estradiol level overall across all ages, which was not explained by racial differences in the prevalence of factors that influence hormone levels. Mexican-American men had hormonal profiles similar to non-Hispanic white men, with the exception of higher testosterone.

# MAOA-uVNTR warrior gene: terminology and overview
MAOA or MAO-A: Monoamine oxidase A helps deaminate ("deactivate") neurologically important amine neurotransmitters including dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoamine_oxidase_A>
MAOA-uVNTR: the region that regulates MAOA production; has multiple polymorphisms (types); can be shorter (lower-activity) or longer (higher-activity)
rs1465108: Variant 1 of uVNTR
rs909525: Variant 2 of uVNTR
rs2235186: Variant 3 of uVNTR
rs2072743: Variant 4 of uVNTR

rs3027409: Variant 6 of uVNTR
rs6323: another MAOA polymorphism unrelated to uVNTR

The promoter region of MAOA located on the short arm of the X chromosome contains a 30 base pair variable number of tandem repeats sequence (VNTR) consisting of 2, 3, 3.5, 4, or 5 repeated copies (Kim-Cohen et al. 2006; Sabol et al. 1998). Transcription of the 3-repeat (short) allele results in reduced MAOA activity and thus increased serotonin in the synapse, putatively increasing risk for aggression and ASB. The frequency of the ‘‘risk’’ allele in nonclinical samples of European ancestry ranges from 0.3 to 0.4, although the frequency of this allele in individuals of Asian and African ancestry appears to be substantially higher (*0.6 in both groups; Sabol et al. 1998). In contrast, the 4-repeat (long) allele results in increased MAOA activity and is considered the low-risk allele (Kim-Cohen et al. 2006). Of the less common alleles, the 3.5- repeat has shown evidence of activity similar to that of the 4-repeat and is thus considered high activity, whereas the 2-repeat is usually grouped with the 3-repeat allele and considered low activity (Kim-Cohen et al. 2006). Classification of the 5-repeat allele has been inconsistent across studies."""

After adjusting for sociologic confounding factors and 9 measures of air pollution, the only indictor of air pollution found to be associated with homicide rates was air lead concentration. Across all counties, estimated air lead concentrations ranged from 0 to 0.17 µg/m3. The adjusted results suggest that the difference between the highest and lowest level of estimated air lead is associated with a homicide incidence rate ratio of 4.12 (95% confidence interval, 1.02-16.61).

For every additional μg/m3 of lead in air, assault rates 21 years later increased by 163 per 100,000 population (see Table 3). Lead in air was the strongest predictor in the model, accounting for 29.8 % of the variance in assault rates 21 years later. By comparison, the proportion of the population aged 15–24 accounted for 5.4 % of the variance, and the proportion of the population who completed secondary school accounted for 5.0 %.

immigration restrictions in the 1910's and 20's caused the immigrant population to age relative to the native one -- and thus saw a corresponding decline in relative crime: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2831353/> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/542377842701369374/unknown.png By 1930, as shown in the top panel, more than half of the foreign-born population was over the age of 30, and more than 10% were 65 or older. These differences in age distributions can have a profound effect on perceptions of relative criminality because age is so strongly correlated with criminal behavior. Crime rates peak for males in late adolescence and decline rather precipitously thereafter. **Comparisons of native and immigrant criminality in 1930 that do not control for these differences in age distributions will necessarily bias the results in favor of immigrants.**

It wasn’t until Jewish immigrants at the turn of the 20th century adopted the “ultimate city game”—and over the course of a few decades, from the ’20s to the ’50s, added innovations in play and strategy—that it went from one requiring brute strength to one that stressed skill and strategy. In their hands, basketball, first conceived as a simple, easy to play (but hard to master) game, became the crossover dribbling, three-point bombing sport that it is today. Contrary to cultural stereotypes, early in the 20th century, most Jewish kids played basketball and played it well."""

Jew Ball provided an easy mark for journalists like Paul Gallico, the eminent sports editor of the NY Daily News who expressed the goy “excuse” in a 1930s column, stating that “the reason that basketball appeals to Hebrews is that the game places a premium on an alert scheming mind, flashy trickiness, artful dodging and general smart-aleckness.” Players who lost to all-Jewish teams whined that the shorter Jews had “God-given better balance and speed.” Genetic advantage or not, the fact is that in 1930, in the biggest college game of the year, with NYU facing CCNY (both teams were undefeated), 9 of the 10 starters were Jewish.

The players then and now were subject to sometimes egregious racial stereotyping. The newest showmen of modern basketball, such as Allen Iverson and Kobe Bryant are singled out for their "athleticism" and "natural talents", rather than their well-rounded play. Such stereotypes reflect a long tradition that goes back more than seven decades, when the game emerged from the ghettos of Philadelphia, New York and Baltimore. Sportswriters then used to wax about the gaudy skills of "natural athletes." Sounds familiar, except the stars had names like Dutch Garfinkel and Doc Lou Sugerman, and the top teams were the Philadelphia "Hebrews", the New York Whirlwinds and the Cleveland Rosenblums."""
^ note that Entine embraces racialist views on sports: <http://web.archive.org/web/20001018052506/http://www.jonentine.com/articles/question_of_race_recon.htm> """So why do we readily accept that evolution has turned out Jews with a genetic predisposition to Tay-Sachs or that colorectal cancer is far more common among those of West African descent, yet find it racist to suggest that West Africans have evolved into the world's best sprinters? Muscle fiber types, reflex capabilities, metabolic efficiency, lung capacity and a host of other variables that determine success in the world of sports are clearly not distributed evenly between populations. Biology circumscribes possibility. "Differences among athletes of elite caliber are so small that if you have an advantage that might be genetically based...it might be very, very significant," notes Michigan State University anthropologist Robert Malina, who studied black/white differences in earning his doctorate in anthropology at Penn.

[....] Nevertheless, as we recognised in the protocol,15 some variability in these populations remained, mostly at the extremes of gestational age in some parameters. This variation might have arisen because of residual secular trends, true inter-ethnic diff erences,10 unstable estimations due to the small sample sizes at some gestational age windows, or simply diff erences in protocol implementation despite our best eff orts to standardise rigorously across the study sites. **However, we confirmed that such variability among sites represents only 3% of the total variance for skeletal growth, whereas the variability in individuals within a site is seven times higher (table 3).** [....] These results support pooling of the data for the construction of international standards. The data are in strong agreement with those of the WHO MGRS, and suggest that **differences reported in the scientific literature in fetal growth and newborn size are more likely due to environmental and socioeconomic differences than genetic variation, as has been shown for infants and children.**

naive examination of skin color variation across areas suggests evolutionary selection, but not cranial shape variation: <http://references.260mb.com/Biometria/Relethford2002.pdf> These methods are applied to global data on craniometric variation (57 traits) and skin color. Multivariate analysis of craniometric variation shows results similar to those obtained from genetic markers and DNA polymorphisms: roughly 13% of the total diversity is among regions, 6% among local populations within regions, and 81% within local populations. This distribution is concordant with neutral genetic markers. Skin color shows the opposite pattern, with 88% of total variation among regions, 3% among local populations within regions, and 9% within local populations, a pattern shaped by natural selection.

Lynn suggest that penis length and girth are greatest in Negroids (sub-Saharan Africans), intermediate in Caucasoids (Europeans, South Asians and North African), and smallest in Mongoloids (East Asians), but this is based upon studies that did not meet our present inclusion and exclusion criteria. The greatest proportion of the participants in the present meta-analysis were Caucasoids. There was only one study of 320 men in Negroids and two studies of 445 men in Mongoloids. There are no indications of differences in racial variability in our present study, e.g. the study from Nigeria was not a positive outlier. The question of racial variability can only be resolved by the measurements with large enough population being made by practitioners following the same method with other variables that may influence penis size (such as height) being kept constant. Future studies should also ensure they accurately report the race of their participants and conduct inter-rater reliability."""

# genetic testing superior
genetic testing is far superior to ethnicity for providing personalized medicine: <https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1038/clpt.2008.114> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/641983496683782184/cptclpt2008114-fig-0001-m.png Given these trends, race/ethnicity should be considered only a makeshift solution for personalized genomics because it is too approximate; known differences may occur within a defined category. One example of such variability is provided by CYP2D6, which is involved in metabolizing codeine, antipsychotics, and antidepressants. The CYP2D6*17 form has moderately lower enzymatic activity than the wild type. However, different populations within Africa can have different frequencies for a variant. The *17 allele in CYP2D6 is found in 9%, 17%, and 34% of the Ethiopian, Tanzanian, and Zimbabwean populations, respectively. Clearly, lumping together all of Africa obscures the differences between the populations. The label “African” or “African-American” is therefore insufficient to determine whether an individual comes from a population with a high frequency of the *17 allele. Even if an individual is known to be, for example, Ethiopian rather than Zimbabwean, the ancestry is less relevant than the true genotype, which could be easily resolved with today's technology.

Those who approach the matter from this angle have a very different view of how to think about diabetes prevention and treatment. In the graphic below on ‘prevalence of diabetes in related populations’ note the striking pattern of urban versus rural dwelling among six populations across the globe. Those who live in urban areas and consume a westernized diet have a very high rate of diabetes, but those who have lived in ‘traditional’ sites where they practice ‘traditional culture’ hardly experience any diabetes.

They enrolled approximately one thousand people who “self-identified as black (defined as of African descent)” and hoped to demonstrate that BiDil was more effective than the placebo. In summer 2004, researchers halted the study prematurely; analysis of the initial data revealed a 43 percent decreased mortality rate among patients on BiDil compared to those on placebo.""""""Opponents of the race-specificity claim argued that such claims were empirically unfounded. After all, the NitroMed study did not enroll any other self-identified races (Dorr and Jones 2008). Hence, it actually had zero data on the effect of race specificity. Still, the power of biological determinism and racial essentialism held. After the FDA’s advisory council met in June 2005 to consider arguments for and against BiDil and its claims of race-specific metabolism, the FDA approved BiDil as a medication indicated for use specifically in self-identified blacks (cf. Gellene 2005)."""

IATs were poor predictors of every criterion category other than brain activity, and the IATs performed no better than simple explicit measures.

Women seek to gain power by getting control over men. 4. When women lose to men in a fair competition, they typically complain about being discriminated against. **Racism:** 1. White people in the U.S. have certain advantages because of the color of their skin. 2. Racial problems in the U.S. are rare, isolated situations. 3. I am angry that racism exists

Areas with high concentration of Mexican immigrants and import exposure to Mexico and China are actually more likely to favor Hillary another Republican candidate or Hillary Clinton.

trump vote is predicted by isolated whiteness, not immigration or importation ("degree affected by globalism"): <https://www.citylab.com/equity/2016/08/racial-segregation-not-economic-hardship-explains-trump/495950/> <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2822059> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/509192930343387146/unknown.png The 2016 US presidential nominee Donald Trump has broken with the policies of previous Republican Party presidents on trade, immigration, and war, in favor of a more nationalist and populist platform. **Using detailed Gallup survey data for 125,000 American adults, we analyze the individual and geographic factors that predict a higher probability of viewing Trump favorably. The results show mixed evidence that economic distress has motivated Trump support. His supporters are less educated and more likely to work in blue collar occupations, but they earn relatively high household incomes and are no less likely to be unemployed or exposed to competition through trade or immigration. On the other hand, living in racially isolated communities with worse health outcomes, lower social mobility, less social capital, greater reliance on social security income and less reliance on capital income, predicts higher levels of Trump support.** We confirm the theoretical results of our regression analysis using machine learning algorithms and an extensive set of additional variables.

london: diversity actually *increases trust* and segregation decreases trust for young people (who grew up in a diverse society) but not for old people: <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01419870.2013.831932> <http://sci-hub.se/10.1080/01419870.2013.831932> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/643217745151787008/rers_a_831932_f0003_oc.png These relationships are strongly moderated by age cohort: the positive effect of diversity and the negative effect of segregation among the youngest adults both weaken over successive cohorts, until the direction of the association is reversed among the oldest residents of London's neighbourhoods. The moderating effect of age on the association between diversity and social cohesion for white residents provides further evidence in support of the idea that growing up in a multicultural society in which ethnic minorities play a visible and positive role serves to shift the attitudes and behaviours of younger ethnic majority cohorts in prosocial directions. [....] We include the following individual-level control variables that are plausibly related to both social cohesion and neighbourhood preference: age; sex; ethnic group; social class; marital status; housing tenure; and the length of time that an individual has lived in the area.
for four measures of positive neighborhood beliefs, class was significant for 4, age for 3, education for 3, racial diversity for 1: <http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-9248.2007.00692.x> <https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/Politics/papers/2005/NLetki_social%20capital%20and%20diversity_final.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/634182353979179008/unknown.png

# metastudies: ethnic diversity
across 87 studies, ethnic diversity negatively predicted trust, but could explain just 0.66% of variation in trust: <https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-polisci-052918-020708> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1146/annurev-polisci-052918-020708> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/767112460351176784/dineson2020.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/638488088557125643/unknown.png In substantive terms, the partial correlation of -0.0256 (se = 0.0044) between ethnic diversity and trust is rather modest. Under the scenario of our back-of-the-envelope calculation (see above), it corresponds to a 0.66% increase in the aggregate between-context unit R^2 after all other variables in the model have been accounted for (see Online Supplement C).
in metastudy, about as many studies studies reject as support the "diversity causes distrust" hypothesis (support:reject ratio of 1:2 for country, 2:1 for region, 1:2 for city, 1.5:1 for neighborhood): <https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-soc-071913-043309> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1146/annurev-soc-071913-043309> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/544262606438006814/unknown.png We find that (a) there is consistent support for the constrict claim for aspects of social cohesion that are spatially bounded to neighborhoods, (b) support for the constrict claim is more common in the United States than in other countries, and (c) ethnic diversity is not related to less interethnic social cohesion.

# metastudies: contact theory
in metastudy, most studies show that contact hypotheses between individuals reduce bigotry by about 0.2-0.4 standard deviation: <https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/142C913E7FA9E121277B29E994124EC5/S2398063X18000258a.pdf/contact_hypothesis_reevaluated.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/634653050677624832/unknown.png

across all cases and with all controls, black males received 18.5% longer sentence than comparable white males: <https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/research-publications/2017/20171114_Demographics.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/738789214363058186/unknown.png """The dependent variable used in each of the analyses was an offender’s total sentence length, in months, which included alternatives to imprisonment. Probationary sentences without conditions of confinement are included as sentences of zero months. The independent variables were: The presumptive sentence, which is the bottom of the applicable sentencing guideline range that applies in a case (i.e., the minimum sentence, in months, to which the offender was subject under the sentencing guidelines, taking into account all guideline, statutory, and mandatory minimum provisions); Type of offense committed (violent, sexual, pornography, drug trafficking, white collar, immigration, or other); Whether a statutory mandatory minimum punishment was applied at sentencing; Whether the court determined that a sentence outside the applicable sentencing guideline range was warranted; Detention status (whether the offender had been released on bail prior to sentencing); Whether the offender pleaded guilty; Race of the offender paired with the gender of the offender; Citizenship of the offender (whether the offender was a United States citizen); Educational level of the offender; and Age of the offender."""

# longer sentences from republicans
Republican-appointed appointed give black defendants 3.0 months longer sentences than similarly situated defendants before Democratic-appointed judges (which explains 65% of the average difference in sentence length between black and white people): <https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/28/us/politics/black-defendants-women-prison-terms-study.html> <https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20170329> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1257/pol.20170329> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/775912725083062272/cohen2019.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/775916813124370452/unknown.png """Exploiting random case assignment, we find that Republican-appointed judges sentence black defendants to 3.0 more months than similar nonblacks and female defendants to 2.0 fewer months than similar males compared to Democratic-appointed judges, 65 percent of the baseline racial sentence gap and 17 percent of the baseline gender sentence gap, respectively. These differences cannot be explained by other judge characteristics and grow substantially larger when judges are granted more discretion."""

# evidence for racial bias
strong evidence for racial bias in the criminal justice system exists: <https://www.law.upenn.edu/live/news/2170-new-study-by-professor-david-s-abrams-confirms> <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1800840> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/505577440848904232/unknown.png We produce these unbiased data with a Monte Carlo simulation by sampling from the actual data but mechanically breaking the judgedefendant race link. We find that there is substantial excess heterogeneity in the empirical distribution of the racial gap in the incarceration rate. The quantitative impact of this gap on sentencing disparity is of considerable magnitude. If a defendant assigned to a 10th-percentile judge was instead sentenced by a 90th-percentile judge, the racial gap in the incarceration rate would rise by a full 18 percentage points.

Today 59% of the U.S. Asian population was born in another country. That share rises to 73% among adult Asians.

I told Spitzer that Nicolosi had asked me to participate in the 2001 study and recount my success in therapy, but that I never called him.

His goal was to determine whether the counterfactual-the claim that no one had ever changed his or her sexual orientation through therapy-was true.""" """I asked about the criticisms leveled at him. "In retrospect, I have to admit I think the critiques are largely correct," he said. "The findings can be considered evidence for what those who have undergone ex-gay therapy say about it, but nothing more." He said he spoke with the editor of the Archives of Sexual Behavior about writing a retraction, but the editor declined."""

Studies of DSD patients and neuroanatomical studies provide the strongest evidence for the organic basis of transgender identity.

In a similar fashion, the recognition of transracial identity might eventually involve a shift away from an emphasis on ancestral ties or skin color of origin toward an emphasis on racial self-identification. In both cases, I think we have stronger reasons to accept individuals’ self-identities than to force them to feel beholden to an identity thrust upon them at birth.10 The argument for this point is broadly Millian; as a rule, we should encourage “different experiments in living” and not interfere with others’ liberty unless doing so would prevent harm to others (Mill 2002, 47). I hope to have shown that harm to members of a race is not an inevitable or obvious consequence of transracialism and, importantly, no more inevitable or obvious in the case of race than of sex."""

self-reported experience of transphobia increases suicide ideation rate: <https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-015-1867-2> Among trans Ontarians, 35.1 % (95 % CI: 27.6, 42.5) seriously considered, and 11.2 % (95 % CI: 6.0, 16.4) attempted, suicide in the past year. Social support, reduced transphobia, and having any personal identification documents changed to an appropriate sex designation were associated with large relative and absolute reductions in suicide risk, as was completing a medical transition through hormones and/or surgeries (when needed). Parental support for gender identity was associated with reduced ideation. Lower self-reported transphobia (10th versus 90th percentile) was associated with a 66 % reduction in ideation (RR=0.34, 95 % CI: 0.17, 0.67), and an additional 76 % reduction in attempts among those with ideation (RR=0.24; 95 % CI: 0.07, 0.82). This corresponds to potential prevention of 160 ideations per 1000 trans persons, and 200 attempts per 1,000 with ideation, based on a hypothetical reduction of transphobia from current levels to the 10th percentile.

self-reported stigma is associated with trans suicide attempt rates: <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08964289.2015.1028322> This study assessed individual (ie, internalized transphobia) and structural forms of stigma as risk factors for suicide attempts among transgender adults. Internalized transphobia was assessed through a 26-item scale including four dimensions: pride, passing, alienation, and shame. State-level structural stigma was operationalized as a composite index, including density of same-sex couples; proportion of Gay–Straight Alliances per public high school; 5 policies related to sexual orientation discrimination; and aggregated public opinion toward homosexuality. Multivariable logistic generalized estimating equation models assessed associations of interest among an online sample of transgender adults (N = 1,229) representing 48 states and the District of Columbia. Lower levels of structural stigma were associated with fewer lifetime suicide attempts (AOR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92–0.997), and a higher score on the internalized transphobia scale was associated with greater lifetime suicide attempts (AOR 1.18, 95% CI 1.04–1.33). Addressing stigma at multiple levels is necessary to reduce the vulnerability of suicide attempts among transgender adults. [xxx reread]

# debunk: sweden study
the study only used **non-transgender individuals** as the control; it cannot evaluate transition status as it affect suicide: <https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016885>  All 324 sex-reassigned persons (191 male-to-females, 133 female-to-males) in Sweden, 1973–2003. Random population controls (10:1) were matched by birth year and birth sex or reassigned (final) sex, respectively. [....] It is therefore important to note that the current study is only informative with respect to transsexual persons health after sex reassignment; no inferences can be drawn as to the effectiveness of sex reassignment as a treatment for transsexualism. In other words, the results should not be interpreted such as sex reassignment per se increases morbidity and mortality. Things might have been even worse without sex reassignment.
the author has repeatedly stated that her study doesn't support anti-SRS or pro-SRS beliefs: <https://www.transadvocate.com/fact-check-study-shows-transition-makes-trans-people-suicidal_n_15483.htm> <https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/6q3e8v/science_ama_series_im_cecilia_dhejne_a_fellow_of/dkuk2tr/> People who misuse the study always omit the fact that the study clearly states that it is not an evaluation of gender dysphoria treatment. If we look at the literature, we find that several recent studies conclude that WPATH Standards of Care compliant treatment decrease gender dysphoria and improves mental health. [....] I have no good recommendation what to do. I have said many times that the study is not design to evaluate the outcome of medical transition. It DOES NOT say that medical transition causes people to commit suicide.

# debunk: williams institute study
the Williams Institute study's suicide risk is *lifetime* rather than per-year so it cannot adequately compare pre- and post-transition (since pre-transition suicides and post-transition suicides would be lumped together, and those who transition might have had higher suicidality pre-transition): <https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/AFSP-Williams-Suicide-Report-Final.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/550176885624143916/unknown.png

# all studies
of 22,725 sexual reassignment surgeries across 46 surgeons, 38 surgeries (.17%) were reversals and 62 patients (0.27%) regretted their surgery: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6212091/> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1097/01.GOX.0000547077.23299.00> Surgeons were asked to select a range representing the number of transgender patients they have surgically treated, and this amounted to a cumulative number of approximately 22,725 patients treated by the cohort. 49% of respondents had never encountered a patient who regretted their gender transition or were seeking detransition care. 12 providers encountered 1 patient with regret and the rest encountered more than one patient. This amounted to a total of 62 patients. There were 13 patients who regretted chest surgery and 45 patients who regretted genital surgery. The composition of the patients who sought detransition is as follows: 16 trans-men, 37 trans-women, and 6 non-binary patients. The most common reason cited for detransition was change in gender identity (22 patients) followed by rejection or alienation from family or social support (8 patients) and difficulty in romantic relationships (7 patients). Chronic post-operative pain was also cited as a reason for detransition. 7 trans-women who sought detransition had vaginal stenosis, 2 had rectovaginal fistulae, and 3 had chronic genital pain. 2 trans-men who sought detransition had a urethral fistula and one had a urethral stricture. 9 of the 46 respondents performed a total of 38 detransition procedures.
just 0.47% report regretting SRS in the UK: <https://epath.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Boof-of-abstracts-EPATH2019.pdf> Of the 3398 patients who had appointments during this period, 16 (0.47%) expressed transition-related regret or detransitioned. Of these 16, one patient expressed regret but was not considering detransitioning, two had expressed regret and were considering detransitioning, three had detransitioned, and ten had detransitioned temporarily. The reasons stated by patients for their regret or detransition included: social factors, reporting physical complications, and changing their mind about their gender identity and identifying as their gender assigned at birth. The 16 patients consisted of 11 trans women, two trans men, two cis men, and one person assigned male at birth who said their gender identity was “trans”.

8% of trans people have ever socially detransitioned, 3% permanently: <https://transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/usts/USTS-Full-Report-Dec17.pdf> """Respondents were asked whether they had ever “de-transitioned,” which was defined as having “gone back to living as [their] sex assigned at birth, at least for a while.” Eight percent (8%) of respondents reported having de-transitioned at some point. Most of those who de-transitioned did so only temporarily: 62% of those who had de-transitioned reported that they were currently living full time in a gender different than the gender they were thought to be at birth."""

Attention to this disparity has been limited, in part because neither the U.S. death certificate nor the NVDRS identify decedents’ sexual orientation or gender identity. Thus, it is not known whether LGBT people die by suicide at higher rates than comparable heterosexual people.

# suicide rate vs slaves
the completed suicide rate among slaves was ~.72 per 100,000 in the USA in 1850: <https://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/1654> <https://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1/1654/KneelandL0506.pdf> <http://web.archive.org/web/20191102161632/https://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1/1654/KneelandL0506.pdf> There are a few sources that provide numbers. Lester includes a table of suicide rates calculated from the 1850 census. 180 According to this, slaves in 1850 had a suicide rate of .72 per 100,000 while whites had a rate of 2.37 and freed slaves a rate of 1.15. P. D. Escott searched Federal Writer's Project Slave Narratives and documented resistance. In his list, which included a total of 413 incidents of resistance, there were seven incidents of suicide. This leaves suicide to account for 1.2% of incidents of resistance.
suicide among black people is diminished by religiosity and self-perception: <https://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/1654> <https://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1/1654/KneelandL0506.pdf> <http://web.archive.org/web/20191102161632/https://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1/1654/KneelandL0506.pdf> However, today there are some black churches which teach that suicide is an unredeemable act. This teaching appears to have developed after Reconstruction but was very likely affected by attitudes toward suicide that trace back to slavery. In the early 1990s, Kevin Early conducted a sociological survey among black churches in Gainesville, Florida, and established that black pastors tend to view suicide as an unredeemable act. “The overall condemnation of suicide as sin remains clear. Terminal or painful disease is no excuse for giving up. It merely enhances the quality of life through struggle. After all, struggling is inherently part of the black experience.” 185 Early establishes that while pastors condemn both suicide and criminal behavior, they tend to label individuals involved in typical property and violent crimes, including homicide, as victims of their environment. They argue that parents were too hard on children, society did not offer them the same benefits as white families, and they did not have good economic or educational opportunities. 186 In contrast, when they discussed suicide, it was uniformly condemned as “sinful” and the belief was proposed that “adversity can be overcome without resorting to suicide.” 187 Blacks described themselves as “able to endure more hardship without succumbing to the despair and despondency that lead to suicide.” 188 Along that same idea, “African Americans view themselves as being more religious, more spiritual than their white counterparts, and more able to endure hardship.”

quoting an anti-trans source: alleged increase in bathroom incidents may be due to media change, not policy change: <http://womanmeanssomething.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/A-Longitudinal-Analysis-of-Media-Reports-at-Target-Stores.pdf> Another potential limitation of our analysis is that we don't know if pressure on Target has impacted media reporting. It may be that in some areas, perhaps in conservative locales, a bias may exist to report more of the total Target incidents occurring. It could also be that in other areas a liberal bias would lead to the suppression of news stories. We have noted a tendency in some states, usually liberal ones, to not report addresses of the incident locations. This may or may not be related to media bias.

Same-sex marriage policies were associated with a 0.6–percentage point (95% CI, –1.2 to –0.01 percentage points) reduction in suicide attempts, representing a 7% relative reduction in the proportion of high school students attempting suicide owing to same-sex marriage implementation. The association was concentrated among students who were sexual minorities.

# homosexuality and masculinity-femininity
women who report greater levels of homosexuality also report higher levels of childhood and adulthood masculinity, and also perform more masculine-ly: <https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fpspp0000077> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1037/pspp0000077> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/719544976047865866/unknown.png """[A]dulthood masculinityfemininity was reported by all 67 women with the 10-item Continuous Gender Identity Scale, which exhibits modest to strong correlates with other measures of reported and observed masculinity-femininity (Rieger et al., 2008; Rieger et al., 2010). Statements included: “Most people see me as more masculine than other women” and “My mannerisms are less feminine than those of other women.” Answers were given on 7-point scales, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Item-reliability (Cronbach’s alpha) was .91. Responses to items were averaged and higher scores represented greater masculinity."""

sexuality (straight, bisexual, gay-lesbian) and intimate partner violence (IPV): differences are only significant between bisexual women and straight women: <https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/cdc_nisvs_victimization_final-a.pdf> <http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Intimate-Partner-Violence-and-Sexual-Abuse-among-LGBT-People.pdf> <https://www.cdc.gov/ViolencePrevention/pdf/NISVS_Report2010-a.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/618175333014962198/unknown.png
most abuse rate studies are terrible: <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X03003458> Probably the most difficult methodological obstacle in studying same-sex intimate violence is obtaining a representative sample; even studies based on large samples typically have used nonrandom sampling methods, with respondent recruitment often occurring through gay and lesbian publications, organizations, and activities [6]. Two studies with better methodology reported prevalence estimates of 25% and 17% for ever having experienced physical victimization in a lesbian relationship 12, 13; these figures are comparable to figures for heterosexual relationships.

# causes of homosexuality
the gay gene doesn't exist: <https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10508-017-1092-4.pdf> However, the search for genes contributing to homosexuality, which started 25 years ago, has been largely unsuccessful. Although a recentlarge genome-wide association study (GWAS) by Sanders et al. (2015) has documented two chromosomal regions associated with male homosexuality (one X-linked, the other on autosome 8), which has resolved some conflicting results obtained from earlier attempts (Bailey et al.,1999; Hamer etal.,1993;Huetal.,1995;Mustanskietal.,2005;Ramagopalan, Dyment, Handunneththi, Rice, & Ebers, 2010; Rice, Anderson, Risch, & Ebers, 1999), both these regions have a small effect sizes and low power in predicting homosexual versus heterosexual orientation. Collectively, GWAS thus indicate that there are nomajor genes contributing to male homosexuality. No comparable studies on female homosexuality exist.

# nonheterosexuality -> child sexual abuse
#####o
# evidence: abuse
in a sample of 175 child sexual abusers, 47% were "fixated" (meaning, attracted to children only) and 53% were "regressed" (meaning, usually attracted to adults but temporarily sexually abusing a child). Of the "regressed", 76% were heterosexual, 24% were bisexual, and 0% were homosexual: <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01542377> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1007/BF01542377> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/638843898118144010/unknown.png
in a sample of 269 child molesters, 237 (88%) were identified as heterosexual, while just 2 (0.7%) could be identified as potentially homosexual: <https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/94/1/41.long> <https://sci-hub.se/10.0000/pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/94/1/41> None of the alleged male offenders against female children was identified by the family or social service agencies as potentially homosexual. [....] Thus, the percentage of girls alleged to have been molested by potentially identifiable lesbian women was 0.4% (1/219). [....] Using the criterion that the alleged offender might possibly be identifiable as being homosexual by the caretaker, there was one male child potentially offended against by ahomosexual male (1 /50 = 2%). [....] Heterosexual relationships were documented for 237 (88%) of the alleged adult offenders.

# child sexual abuse -> nonheterosexuality
#####o
# rates
in a worldwide metastudy, being the victim of child sexual abuse was about 3x higher for male homosexuals than male heterosexuals and about 2x higher for female homosexuals than female heterosexuals: <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10538712.2015.1006746> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1080/10538712.2015.1006746> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/638347070880743424/unknown.png This meta-analysis revealed no significant difference between the prevalence of CSA across lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals. This was true for both sexes; the prevalence of CSA among male sexual minorities was 22.2% and for female sexual minorities was 36.2%. These values appear to differ widely from those of heterosexual people: Pereda and colleagues (2009b) found that the prevalence of CSA was 7.9% in men and 19.7% in women in general sample, and Stoltenborgh and colleagues (2011) found that the prevalence of CSA was 7.6% in men and 18.0% in women. Thus, we might conclude that the prevalence of CSA among sexual minorities is higher than that among heterosexuals.
in a USA metastudy, homosexuals were 1-4x more likely to be the victim of child sexual abuse: <https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2009.190009> <http://sci-hub.se/10.2105/AJPH.2009.190009> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/638346922096066560/unknown.png Sexual minority individuals were on average 3.8, 1.2, 1.7, and 2.4 times more likely to experience sexual abuse, parental physical abuse, or assault at school or to miss school through fear, respectively.

# causes
causation may be reversed: gender-nonconforming children are more likely to be abused, not vice versa: <https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1079063215618378> <http://sci-hub.se/10.1177/1079063215618378> The instrumental variable analysis revealed that the increased prevalence of CSA experienced by nonheterosexuals compared with heterosexuals may be due to the influence of sexual orientation on CSA. In sum, the results suggest that nonheterosexuality may increase the risk of childhood sexual abuse.

# poland
before illegalization in 1990, Poland had about 100-200,000 abortions per year (adjust this to live births): <http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/ab-poland.html>
A poll of Polish women suggests lifetime abortion rates of 1/3-1/4 (compared to 1/4 in the USA): <https://www.cbos.pl/SPISKOM.POL/2013/K_060_13.PDF> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/602342144627179521/unknown.png W ciągu swojego życia ciążę przerwała, z dużym prawdopodobieństwem, nie mniej niż co czwarta, ale też nie więcej niż co trzecia dorosła Polka. W skali całego społeczeństwa daje to od 4,1 do 5,8 mln kobiet. [Not less than 1/4 but not more than 1/3 of adult Polish women have interrupted their pregnancy during their life, with high probability. On the scale of the whole society this gives between 4.1 and 5.8 million women.] <http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/uslifetimeab.html> Summary: It is estimated here that, as of 2008, about 28% of U.S. women ages 15-64 have had abortions. This figure has risen from 2.8% in 1973 to 11% in 1980, 19% in 1987, 24% in 1994, and 27% in 2001. In 2008, of women ages 40-55, about 40% have had abortions in their lifetimes.
studies by the Polish Federation for Women and Family Planning provide similar estimates of 1/4 lifetime exposure and yearly counts of 100,000+: <https://www.theseus.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/138222/thesis_Ewa_Hirvonen.pdf?sequence=1> <http://wyborcza.pl/7,87648,20314186,zasadzka-na-anestezjologa.html> <http://wyborcza.pl/1,76842,8300922,Polskie_aborcje_w_klinikach_calej_Europy.html> For instance Wanda Nowicka, head of the Federation for Women and Family Planning, estimated in 2010 that approximately 80 000-200 000 Polish women terminate unintended pregnancies every year. According to her, 10-15% of these abortions are induced abroad. (Dubrowska 2010.) This estimation would mean that up to 30 000 Polish women travel each year abroad to seek abortion. According to the latest estimations of the Federation for Women and Family Planning (2016), over 100 000 abortions are induced every year in Poland, meaning that every fourth Polish woman has experienced an abortion.

# Invisible Victims: Delayed Onset Depression among Adults with Same-Sex Parents
sullins' study: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4903140/>
sullins counted any child who ever lived in a household headed by a gay person as a child growing up in a same-sex household -- including single or divorced parents: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5204108/> Sullins achieves this through a crucial elision between households in which a child spent some time in a home headed by a same-sex couple and families in which a child was actually raised, from birth, by a stable same-sex couple, a situation more auspicious for healthy child development. This conflation of household stability with parent gender fatally mars his conclusions, which are much more damning of gay and lesbian parenting than are warranted by his data. [....] This descriptor, of course, is the key variable in the discourse on optimal child-rearing because of the well-established fact that children who experience divorce or other family disruptions are at higher risk for a number of disadvantages, including the ones that Sullins inaccurately associates with “same-sex parented” households. What Sullins has done makes no more sense than surveying a hospital to derive mortality rates. It is hard to imagine that Sullins does not know this and equally hard to watch his misleading findings get past peer review.

# gay parenting
the American Psychological Association believes sexuality is not a significant predictor of parenting outcomes: <http://www.bu.edu/today/2013/gay-parents-as-good-as-straight-ones/> <http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/early/2013/03/18/peds.2013-0377.full.pdf> On the basis of this comprehensive review of the literature regarding the development and adjustment of children whose parents are the same gender, as well as the existing evidence for the legal, social, and health benefits of marriage to children, the AAP concludes that it is in the best interests of children that they be able to partake in the security of permanent nurturing and care that comes with the civil marriage of their parents, without regard to their parents’ gender or sexual orientation.
75 studies demonstrate that same-sex couples and different-sex couples produce roughly equivalent children: <https://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-the-wellbeing-of-children-with-gay-or-lesbian-parents/>  A 2010 study by Stanford researcher Michael Rosenfeld used census data to examine the school advancement of 3,500 children with same-sex parents, finding no significant differences between households headed by same-sex and opposite-sex parents when controlling for family background. Another study drew on nationally representative, longitudinal data using a sampling pool of over 20,000 children, of which 158 lived in a same-sex parent household. Controlling for family disruptions, those children showed no significant differences from their peers in school outcomes.
in meta-analysis, two dads vs two moms was insignificant: <https://thewinnower.com/papers/3532-knowing-what-we-don-t-know-a-meta-analysis-of-children-raised-by-gay-or-lesbian-parents>  A third potential explanation, based on theories of gender development (Leaper & Friedman, 2007; McHale, Crouter, & Whiteman, 2003), has to do with the presence of a parent of the same or opposite gender as the child. There was, however, no support for this explanation. Children raised by gay fathers were no different than children raised by lesbian mothers, and the differences associated with parent sexual orientation did not vary between boys and girls.
in meta-analysis, same-sex parents appear to do worse on some indicators (internalizing, externalizing, social competence, academic competence) and better on others (positive relationships, parental warmth), but the data is usually of such poor quality that no reliable conclusions can be drawn (the moderator effects have larger size than the effect size): <https://thewinnower.com/papers/3532-knowing-what-we-don-t-know-a-meta-analysis-of-children-raised-by-gay-or-lesbian-parents> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/587971826961874951/unknown.png

The proposal would allow the presumed father, the biological father or the mother to challenge the paternity until a child turns 2. The proposal had two goals: to balance the rights of children with those of their presumed fathers and to encourage parentage questions to be raised early in a child’s life, before deep bonds are formed. Several states, including Delaware, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wyoming, have adopted that model or a variation of it.

No new infections occurred among any of the 50 circumcised men over 30 months, whereas 40 of 137 uncircumcised men became infected during this time. Both groups had been given free access to HIV testing, intensive instruction about preventing infection, and free condoms (which were continuously available), but 89% of the men never used condoms, and condom use did not seem to influence the rate of transmission of HIV.

Similarly, girls might have scored higher than boys in science, but they were often even better in reading. Critically, the magnitude of these sex differences in personal academic strengths and weaknesses was strongly related to national gender equality, with larger differences in more gender-equal nations. These intraindividual differences in turn may contribute, for instance, to parental beliefs that boys are better at science and mathematics than girls (Eccles & Jacobs, 1986; Gunderson, Ramirez, Levine, & Beilock, 2012). We also found that boys often expressed higher selfefficacy, more joy in science, and a broader interest in science than did girls. These differences were also larger in more gender-equal countries and were related to the students’ personal academic strength.

# genuine preference: personality tests
sex differences in Big Five personality traits and occupational preferences were mostly consistent across countries, with more gender-equal countries actually having *higher* variation in agreeableness: <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-008-9380-7> <http://sci-hub.se/10.1007/s10508-008-9380-7> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/618482883895492648/unknown.png
data from Swedish male-female twins suggests that male and female distributions of personality on the Big Five are ~1 standard deviation apart and that genetics explains ~1/3 of these differences; prenatal hormones also probably affect these differences: <https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/twin-research-and-human-genetics/article/individual-differences-in-personality-masculinityfemininity-examining-the-effects-of-genes-environment-and-prenatal-hormone-transfer/C5C72DBFD24FA1E7D9B460B9047F43FC/core-reader> <http://sci-hub.se/10.1017/thg.2016.8> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/618488340806631434/unknown.png """On average, males scored 1.09 standard deviations higher on the discriminant score than females, indicating a large effect size (males Mean = 0.64 [SD = 1.01], females Mean=-0.45 [SD = 0.99]). The canonical correlation between participants’ sex and the discriminant score was 0.47, indicating that the personality items combined can explain 22% of the group membership (Wilks’ Lambda = 0.78, p < .001). Based on the discriminant function, the sex of 72% of participants could be correctly classified.""""""Males with a male co-twin scored on average 0.61 (SD = 1.00) and males with a female-co-twin 0.70 (SD = 1.01) on the derived M-F personality scale. Females with a female co-twin scored on average -0.49 (SD = 0.99) and females with a male-co-twin -0.38 (SD = 1.01). So, both male and female participants from opposite-sex pairs scored significantly higher on the M-F personality scale (both approximately 0.1 SD more masculine) than did males and females from same-sex pairs.""""""[B]road-sense heritability estimates are 35% for males and 33% for females. Also, we found some evidence for non-additive genetic influences, especially for females. The majority of the variance in the derived personality score can be explained by residual influences, including non-shared environmental influences and measurement error."""

# genuine preference: biology
females with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) who cannot produce androgen (a sex hormone) were shifted towards male preferences on the "things-people" scale: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3166361/> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/565946988328124417/unknown.png """The results support the hypothesis that sex differences in occupational interests are due, in part, to prenatal androgen influences on differential orientation to objects versus people. Compared to unaffected females, females with CAH reported more interest in occupations related to Things versus People, and relative positioning on this interest dimension was substantially related to amount of prenatal androgen exposure. Females with CAH scored in between males and typical females on the Things-People dimension; their intermediate score might reflect a dose effect of prenatal androgen or the feminizing effects of socialization or other biological factors related to XX karyotype."""

# social conditioning
performing gender may cause hormone differences (rather than the reverse): <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4653185/> Using a novel experimental design, participants (trained actors) performed a specific type of competition (wielding power) in stereotypically masculine vs. feminine ways. We hypothesized in H1 (stereotyped behavior) that wielding power increases testosterone regardless of how it is performed, vs. H2 (stereotyped performance), that wielding power performed in masculine but not feminine ways increases testosterone. We found that wielding power increased testosterone in women compared with a control, regardless of whether it was performed in gender-stereotyped masculine or feminine ways. Results supported H1 over H2: stereotyped behavior but not performance modulated testosterone. These results also supported theory that competition modulates testosterone over masculinity. Our findings thus support a gender→testosterone pathway mediated by competitive behavior. Accordingly, cultural pushes for men to wield power and women to avoid doing so may partially explain, in addition to heritable factors, why testosterone levels tend to be higher in men than in women: A lifetime of gender socialization could contribute to “sex differences” in testosterone. Our experiment opens up new questions of gender→testosterone pathways, highlighting the potential of examining nature/nurture interactions and effects of socialization on human biology.

# single parenthood / single motherhood
#####o
# divorce necessary: conflict bad
high-conflict married families were just as likely to have negative outcomes as were single mothers: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2930824/> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2010.03.002> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/636527287981965362/unknown.png Despite caveats concerning potential underestimates of conflict, we find that children from high conflict married-parent families do more poorly in the domains of schooling and substance use, and are at greater risk of early family formation and dissolution, relative to children from low conflict married-parent families. In half of our outcomes, high conflict, stepfather, and single-mother families are statistically indistinguishable in their associations with young adult well-being. [....] Compared to those from low conflict married-parent families, the risks of each of our family-related transitions are anywhere from 25% to upwards of 100% greater for children from high conflict married-parent, stepfather, and single-mother families (not statistically significant in the case of high conflict married-parent families and early cohabitation). Risks also tend to be greater for children from stepfather and single-mother families, relative to children from high conflict married-parent families, although differences are not consistently statistically significant (see “key contrasts”).
mothers who are single by choice (rather than separation, divorce, death, etc.) had insignificantly different parenting outcomes from married mothers, except that single mothers had less-frequent "battles" with children: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4886836/> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1037/fam0000188> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/636529228954861588/unknown.png There were no differences in parenting quality between family types apart from lower mother–child conflict in solo mother families. Neither were there differences in child adjustment. Perceived financial difficulties, child’s gender, and parenting stress were associated with children’s adjustment problems in both family types. The findings suggest that solo motherhood, in itself, does not result in psychological problems for children.

# weak effect: crime
the rate of single motherhood *today* has a large, significant positive correlation with crime -- but single motherhood *18 years ago* had a small, significant negative correlation with crime: <https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1069397104267479> Regression analyses that controlled for masculinity of the population (sex ratio of 15- to 64-year-olds) and national wealth (log gross national product, GNP, per capita) found that current single parenthood ratios were strongly and consistently predictive of violent crimes, whereas single parenthood ratios 18 years ago were not. [....] Even more remarkable were the regression results, in which a large positive effect of 1991 illegitimacy ratios on all violent-crime measures was produced. None of the regressions produced a positive relationship between 1972 illegitimacy ratios and crime, providing a remarkably clear rejection of the parental investment hypothesis in favor of the mating competition prediction.

# weak effect: variety
single parenthood explained just 1% of the variation of adult outcomes: <https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/482426> In agreement with much previous research into the effects of single parenthood on children, increasing exposure to a single-parent family in childhood was associated with increasing risks of later anxiety, poorer educational and economic outcomes, and criminal offending. However, these associations were rather weak, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.01 to 0.22 (median, 0.10). These results imply that, typically, variation in exposure to single parenthood accounted for about 1% of the variation in outcomes in adulthood. These statistics reflected the facts that (1) most of those exposed to single parenthood did not develop later difficulties and (2) many of those developing later difficulties were not exposed to single parenthood.
anxiety disorder rates, university degree rates, welfare dependence, income, arrest or conviction rates, and property or violence offences were insignificantly correlated with single motherhood: <https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/482426> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/640935399824556045/yoa70019t2.png Table 2 shows that, when due allowance was made for social and contextual factors associated with single parenthood, the duration of exposure to single parenthood during childhood was largely unrelated to later outcomes. There were only 2 possible exceptions to this trend; after adjustment, significant associations (P < .05) remained between exposure to single parenthood and later anxiety disorder and welfare dependence. At the same time, given the many comparisons made in Table 2, these associations could be due to chance variation as a result of multiple tests of significance. To address this issue, a Bonferroni-adjusted38P value (P < .007) was used to correct for multiple (n = 7) tests of significance. In this instance, the adjusted associations between exposure to single parenthood and later anxiety disorder and between single parenthood and welfare dependence were not statistically significant (P > .007) using the Bonferroni correction.

# summary
The most important document in North Korea is the Ten Principles, which citizens have to learn and possibly memorize, and which is de facto superior even to the Constitution. The document outlines the expectations that citizens have absoute loyalty to the Kim family and Juche or Kim-Il-sung-Kim-Jong-ilist ideology.

# history
the document went through two versions: the 1974 version "Ten Principles for Establishing the Party's Single-Ideology System" [당의 유일적령도체계 확립의 10대 원칙] was announced by Kim Il-sung in 1967 and published by Kim Jong-il in 1974 before consolidating power in 1980; the 2013 version "Ten Principles for Establishing the Party's Single-Leadership System" [당의 유일적령도체계확 립의 10대 원칙] was announced <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Principles_for_the_Establishment_of_a_Monolithic_Ideological_System>
in 1967, Kim Il-Sung purged the Kapsang Faction (which wanted economic reforms, to reduce the personality cult, and appoint one of its own as Kim's successor) and established the Ten Principles to cement his leaderist role: <https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/the-1967-purge-the-gapsan-faction-and-establishment-the-monolithic-ideological-system> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapsan_Faction_Incident>

Lim 2018: <https://www.google.com/books/edition/Leader_Symbols_and_Personality_Cult_in_N/pcwqBwAAQBAJ> """Symbolically speaking, it is apt to describe North Korea as a "leader state." By regulating North Koreans through the use of the Ten Principles, and monopolizing their socialization possibilities through creating an isolated social setting, the North Korean state can guarantee the stable functioning of its cult system."""
Green 2012: the Ten Principles seems to supercede the constitution, according to emigrants: <https://sinonk.com/2012/06/05/chris-green-on-10-principles/> <https://archive.ph/Q9zxq> """Regardless, as a result of this shortsightedness there are many North Korea experts and students who have seemingly now forgotten that looking at North Korea only through the materials officially disseminated by the North Korean authorities will not provide all, or indeed most, of the answers. This includes the Socialist ‘Constitution’ of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, for the country only has one constitution, and it is the Ten Principles."""
Daily NK 2013: <https://www.dailynk.com/english/what-are-the-ten-principles/> """The ten main principles and 65 sub-clauses of the Ten Principles describe in detail how to go about establishing the one-ideology system. All North Koreans have to memorize them. Not only that, they have to put them into practice; during regular evaluation meetings, people criticize themselves on the basis of whether or not they have been living up to the Ten Principles in their everyday lives."""

It was secretly carried out of the country by a collaborator inside North Korea."""

Paektu Mountain [백두산, also Baekdu Mountain or Changbai Mountain] is the tallest mountain in Korea and is mythologically the birthplace of Dangun Wanggeom, the founder of the first Korean Kingdom; the Kim family highlights the mountain in their propaganda and refers to themselves as the Paektu bloodline: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paektu_Mountain> <http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2013/08/13/2013081301558.html> <https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20130812004400315> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/868653110028009532/255px-Emblem_of_North_Korea.png

"""Kim Jong-un had to inherit the lineage and ideas of his grandfather and father, and to present his own ruling ideology for the construction of a new society. [...] [The ideology of] Kim-Il-sung-Kim-Jong-ilism contains the aspect of proving that [Kim Jong-un] is a faithful successor by showing filial piety, the aspect of making [him] great, and the granting of legitimacy to the lineage of Mt. Baekdu (Young-Chul Jung 2012, 2-3). This can be seen in Article 10 of the Ten Principles [.]""" [김정은으로 혈통세습이 이루어지면서 선대인 할아버지, 아버지의 사상도 계승해야만 했 고, 나름의 새로운 사회건설을 위한 통치이념을 제시해야만 했다.

The second paragraph also stipulates that the blood of our party and the revolution-the Paektu Mountain bloodline should be continued forever... and its absolute purity should be resolutely maintained. In the previous "Ten Principles," Article 10, paragraph 1, stated that the only leadership system of the Party Central Committee should be established under the leadership of leader Kim Il Sung. A researcher at a South Korean National Policy Research Institute said, North Korea emphasized The Baektu Mountain descent, and clearly stipulated hereditary system, strengthened the idolization of the three generations of Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il and Kim Jong-un's "Kim family", which is tantamount to recognizing that North Korea is a modern feudal country. The revised "Ten Principles" also include, "Make the Sun Palace of Jinxiu Mountain (the place where the remains of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il) an eternal sacred place, and vowed to defend to the death (Article 2)" and "Treat it solemnly. Works and slogans with portraits, statues, and videos of the great Baektu Mountain, and resolutely protect (Article 3)" and other content. The Kim Jong-un family is called "the great men of Mount Paektu". Article 4 also stipulates that the instructions of the leader (Kim Il Sung), the quotations of the general (Kim Jong Il), and the line and policies of the Party (Kim Jong Un regime) shall be regarded as the principles and creeds of career and life, and shall be regarded as the measure of everything According to those requirements, think and act in accordance with those requirements anytime and anywhere."""

# history
after the war, North Korea developed rapidly and was more industrialized than the South until the 1970's; just as quickly, it afterward stagnated and saw flat or declining standards of living: <https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/the-1967-purge-the-gapsan-faction-and-establishment-the-monolithic-ideological-system>
North Korea:  """North Korea released relatively detailed statistics in the 1950s, but stopped publishing official data from the 1960s. Japanese scholars, Goto and Niwa, tried to estimate North Korea’s GDP using a method similar to the NMP-based method applied by the CIA to estimate the Soviet’s GDP (Goto, 1990; Niwa and Goto, 1989). However, while this worked until 1960, the lack of data made this endeavor no longer feasible. In addition, because there was significantly less data for North Korea than the Soviet Union, various assumptions had been made in the estimation of GDP, making the accuracy of the estimates somewhat suspect."""

# lack of gdp data: no publication
Kim 2007: total factor productivity (TFP) was low or negative for most of North Korea's history, and most growth resulted from increased capital stock and intensity: <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596707000327> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1016/j.jce.2007.04.001> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/879888985705574440/kim2007.pdf>

Kim 2021: growth in budget data is nominal and includes loans, and is also not listed by specific budget items, which makes using it as an estimate for real growth difficult: <https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/234189> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/879877812801134622/kim2021.pdf> """Recent discussions on the North Korean growth rate also show potential for such errors. In a recent paper, the author assessed the economic conditions of North Korea to be reasonable after believing that the 4.2% growth in the 2020 budget plan released in April was the economic growth rate. But, as I pointed out earlier, the budget and settlement of accounts is a nominal variable, and in the Soviet’s case, it included its central bank loans in the budget income. There is no guarantee that North Korea is any different. And, unless specific items of the budget account are clearly stated, doubt will only escalate."""

In absolute terms, these are much lower than the North Korean data. But remarkably, the correlation coefficient for this South Korean estimate and North Korea’s officially announced achieved revenue (blue line) from 2005 to 2011 is relatively high with r=0.65 .... In other words, although both sides seem to differ about the amount of growth, at least there is some moderately strong agreement about its general direction.

# causes of slow growth: low tfp growth
Kim 2007: total factor productivity (TFP) was low or negative for most of North Korea's history, and most growth resulted from increased capital stock and intensity: <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596707000327> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1016/j.jce.2007.04.001> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/879888985705574440/kim2007.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/879887043839291403/unknown.png https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/879886702666195025/unknown.png """We find that, taking distortions in output and price statistics into account, the average annual growth rate of North Korean GNP and GNP per capita from 1954 to 1989 was 4.4 and 1.9%, respectively. The average annual growth rates of GNP are fairly comparable to those of the Soviet economy from 1928 to 1985 according to Western estimates but the rates per capita are well below those of most socialist economies in the same period (Ofer, 1987). [....] Our findings indicate that the main cause of slow or negative economic growth was extremely low total factor productivity, and that the productivity of the North Korean economy had been lower than that of the Soviet economy by 33%."""

# reforms over time
Frank 2017: the proportion of the economy that is not centrally planned is increasing: <https://www.38north.org/2017/04/rfrank042817/> The share of budget revenue coming from “local areas” is planned to reach 26.7 percent in 2017, compared to 23.2 percent in 2016 and a mere 16.1 percent in 2011. This implies that the part of the economy that is not centrally controlled is still growing, an impression I can confirm based on what I saw during my recent visits to North Korea. The Minister of Finance who delivered the report actually said that “Provinces, cities and counties envisage ensuring expenditures with their own local revenues and adding their profits to the state budget.” In other words, their income has reached a stage where they become mainly self-sufficient.

First among these was its own experience as an aid recipient and host to foreign investment. After China opened to the outside world and began to receive aid and investment from the West, and particularly from Japan, Chinese policymakers learned a new model of how aid could also serve China’s own development goals. The second influence was a pattern of state-sponsored engagement **more characteristic of the East Asian developmental state than of a communist dictatorship.**"""

Data reported by debtor countries to the World Bank suggest that most Chinese loans are concessional, but with terms that may not be the most favorable for LIDCs.1 Most Chinese loans to LIDCs have fixed interest rates with a median rate of 2 percent, a grace period of 6 years, and a maturity of 20 years. Terms to LIDCs have been stable over time, corresponding to a median grant element of 40 percent. The median annual maturity of loans to EMEs fluctuates between 12 and 18 years, and the grace period between 3 and 5 years. A growing share of loans to EMEs have flexible interest rates, benchmarked to the 6-month LIBOR rate. Interest rates that Chinese lenders apply to LIDCs are on average more favorable than loans to EMEs but remain higher than those available from other creditors for countries at low and moderate risk of debt distress. The median loan from China fully disburses between 2.5 and 7.5 years from the year of commitment, in both LIDCs and EMEs.

one cause for this: no conversion to dollars necessary: <http://www.sais-cari.org/publications-working-papers> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/792571707474968606/brautigam2016.pdf> """We see evidence of a parallel practice [to Japan financing developing in China in return for exports of coal and crude oil] in China’s zero-interest foreign aid loans to Africa in past decades: the Chinese commonly allowed borrowing governments to repay these RMB loans in export commodities.35 This barter-like arrangement freed both China and the host government from the higher transaction costs of having to do multiple conversions into dollars."""
another cause for this: increased security of the investment (for the Chinese lender): <http://www.sais-cari.org/publications-working-papers> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/792571707474968606/brautigam2016.pdf> """The point of securities like these is not for the lender (or a Chinese company) to acquire ownership of an oil well, cocoa farm, railway system, or electrical grid, but to reduce the lender’s risks in a country without a good credit rating, or where projects lack sovereign guarantees (or where sovereign guarantees are not very meaningful). For example, Angola is the largest borrower of Chinese oil-secured loans, and China imports 49 percent of Angola’s oil, partly in repayment for those loans. Yet Chinese oil companies own only a little more than 10 percent of the oil being produced in Angola; Western companies like ExxonMobil and Total dominate Angolan oil investments dating back decades.39 An escrow account filled by commodity exports or an off-take of electricity sales increases security and lowers risk. This allows projects to be financed at a reasonable interest rate."""

CHRD 2018: despite making up just ~1.6% of the Chinese population, fifth of all criminal arrests in China in 2017 took place in Xinjiang, despite the region only being home to a little over 20 million of China’s 1.3 billion people <https://www.nchrd.org/2018/07/criminal-arrests-in-xinjiang-account-for-21-of-chinas-total-in-2017/> <https://archive.vn/8YMOp> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/813925870372388874/unknown.png
Grayzone 2018: CHRD is headquartered in Washington, DC and funded by the National Endowment for Democracy: <https://thegrayzone.com/2018/08/23/un-did-not-report-china-internment-camps-uighur-muslims/> "CHRD’s 2015 form 990 discloses that $819,553 of its $820,023 revenue that year (99.94 percent) came from government grants. A measly $395 came from investments, with another $75 from other sources."
CHRD is heavily funded by the US government. However, the claims CHRD makes are correctly quoted from Chinese state publications. This data demonstrates that the rate of criminal arrests and indictments sharply increased in Xinjiang relative to the rest of China in 2017. <https://socdoneleft.org/2021/03/03/uighur-mass-internment-chinese-criminal-prosecution-data-chrd-and-grayzone/>

# mobility
the societies of the USSR and Eastern Bloc had higher mobility before the transition from the communist era to the capitalist era: <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0276562416302104> <http://sci-hub.se/10.1016/j.rssm.2017.10.004> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/564802213826789406/unknown.png The hypothesis regarding the effect of the transition  on intergenerational inequality in educational attainment is tested by introducing a dummy variable for the transitional cohort, and its interaction terms with parental education and occupational social class. With this regression specification in Model 4, Table 2, coefficients for social origins refer to the communist period. The characteristics of Model 3, particularly in terms of parental education, are largely maintained for individuals born between 1958 and 1972, which suggests that **there have not been radical changes in intergenerational social mobility patterns in post-communist societies**. Still, the coefficients for social origins and their interactions with the transitional cohort indicate that intergenerational inequality in educational attainment has been affected in the following ways: the interaction term between primary education and transitional cohort is statistically significant and has negative sign, which suggests that **the disadvantage associated with low parental education intensified in post-communist societies**. Nonetheless, the tertiary education-transitional cohort interaction coefficient indicates that **the advantage of having parents with a high level of education was simultaneously reduced**. Related trends are observed in relation to parental social class. In this case, the positive effect of salariat origin on individuals’ educational attainment declined, but the negative effect of working class origin intensified. In other words, **the gap between individuals from working and intermediate class origin widened during the transition**. This is in line with existing evidence that indicates that the workers were in privileged conditions in the communist era but that their situation deteriorated thereafter (Eyal and Townsley, 1995, Szelenyi, 2002).

Weitzman 1970 challenged this interpretation by estimating a production function for the USSR. He concluded that the Cobb-Douglas specification was incorrect, and that the Soviet experience was better represented by a CES function with an elasticity of substitution between capital and labour of .4. In this framework, the growth deceleration is due to diminishing returns to capital; there is not evidence of a fall in TFP growth. The growth slowdown, in other words, does not indicate poor institutional performance. Easterley and Fisher have redone the econometrics with more recent data and confirmed the elasticity of substitution. They have been reluctant, however, to exonerate Soviet institutions.""""""One indicator of the change is unfilled vacancies on the first shift, which rose from 1 per cent in 1960, to 4.9 per cent in 1970, to 7.3 per cent in 1975, then to 9.9 per cent in 1980, and finally hit 12.2 per cent in 1985 Rumer 1989, 199–200. In the 1970s a Gosplan research director reported that 10–12 per cent of the increment in real fixed capital was unutilized, owing to a shortage of labour Rumer 1989, 202. and that proportion could only have increased in the 1980s. The capital stock rose without a corresponding rise in GDP because there was no labour to operate the new capacity."""
Allen 2001: Allen's preferred hypothesis is that TFP growth did slow because the USSR's capital investment decisions were terrible: <https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3131928.pdf> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/0008-4085.00103> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/858784395535319040/allen2001.pdf> """Weitzman’s econometrics imply a value of 0.403 – a figure confirmed by Easterly and Fischer ~1995, 357! for the whole economy. But 0.4 is an unusually low value. Evidence for Japan and other advanced capitalist economies suggests a value of 1.0 or even greater ~Easterly and Fischer 1995, 359–61; Duffy and Papageorgiou 2000!. While simulations using an elasticity of substitution of 0.403 imply a growth slowdown, simulations with a value of 1.0 do not. With more substitutability between capital and labour, diminishing returns to capital are not substantial enough to cause stagnation, and this is why a high investment rate paid off in Japan but not in the USSR.""""""Weitzman and Easterly and Fischer speculate on reasons why the elasticity of substitution might have been lower in the USSR than elsewhere, without coming to firm conclusions. This is good; for, I will argue, the value of 0.4 is an illusion. The low measured value of the elasticity reflects massive errors in Soviet investment strategy rather than a real difference in technology. It was not purely happenstance that these errors occurred in the 1970s and 1980s; for the end of the surplus labour economy posed new management problems, and the party leadership bungled them."""

investment of the USSR in Siberia involved huge wastes of resources: <https://books.google.com/books?id=5OvaO4Cb8SsC&lpg=PR9&ots=q9rDs7DhpY&dq=How%20Communist%20Planners%20Left%20Russia%20Out%20in%20the%20Cold&lr&pg=PA51#v=onepage&q&f=false> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/643430247840350219/unknown.png

# failure of planning
the USSR's non-mathematical, "command economy" planning was unable to handle increasingly complex production chains: <https://thenextrecession.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/sovietplanningltc_seongjin_urpe20180928.pdf> Stalinist planners tried to resolve the problem of complexity inherent in a planned economy by concentrating on a limited number of sectors. Indeed, Gosplan planned only a few strategic industries, targeting the ministries and not individual companies. [....] In 1951, Gosplan’s Five-Year Plan was compiled for 127 products, while material balances, the main tool of planning, were prepared for 60 products, although there were millions of products in contemporary Russia (Gregory, 2004: 117, 152). [....] Accurate techniques like input-output tables or optimal linear programming, which could balance supply and demand, were never applied to Stalinist planning. Gosplan planned to produce goods or services on an aggregated, rather than disaggregated basis, so balancing the national economy through consistent planning was impossible from the start. In fact, Stalinist planning was not meant to achieve a balanced national economy: unbalanced growth was not a problem to be avoided but tolerated and even promoted.
the USSR's incentives system encouraged playing it safe, not playing it well: <https://www.jec.senate.gov/reports/100th%20Congress/Gorbachev's%20Economic%20Plan%20Volume%20I%20(1438).pdf> From the point of view of suppliers, the willingness of Soviet managers to pursue costs savings through asset replacement is deterred by what a leading Soviet investment expert terms "self reproduction", the propensity toward the perpetuation of existing technology, which has assured sources of material supply and provides near-certain production bonuses. [....] Reliance on longstanding sources of materials supply to insure against external (to the enterprise or ministry) supply disruptions also slows technical advance.3 2 Centralized planning promises a producer an adequate allocation of necessary inputs but provides no guarantee of timely and sufficient delivery. As a result, a good deal of Soviet machinery is produced in small machine shops attached to the consuming organization rather than in large-scale machinebuilding ministries. Only the specialized ministries, however, can afford to support the research and testing facilities required to develop advanced technology. To the degree that the propensity toward vertical integration (self-sufficiency) prevails, Soviet industry forgoes the benefits of division of labor that characterize modern industry in market economies. [....] Technological backwardness is also explained by insufficient supplier initiative. In market economies, most technical progress at the plant level originates in sales pressure by equipment suppliers. The basic Soviet shortcoming is institutional. In the Soviet system, research and development is separated originally from production. The incentives for R&D organizations reward expenditures of budget allocations more than completion of projects or the satisfaction of consumer demand.

# intensive and extensive growth
until the 1980's, the USSR did not prioritize "intensive" growth: <https://www.jec.senate.gov/reports/100th%20Congress/Gorbachev's%20Economic%20Plan%20Volume%20I%20(1438).pdf> As both Soviet and Western observers of Soviet economic development have repeatedly said,' the traditional Soviet approach to growth has stressed the rapid infusion of labor, fixed capital, and raw materials into industry. Compared with the path followed by industrializing market economies, there has been proportionately far less effort to increase the productivity of either existing or new manpower and capital assets. Since 1960, the USSR-among the major industrial economies-has experienced the most rapid growth of employment and, along with Japan, the fastest growth of fixed capital stock. In sharp contrast, the Soviet Union has shown the lowest rate of increase in both labor and capital productivity (table 1). In official Soviet jargon the traditional approach is termed "extensive" and the alternative path of stress upon productivity as "intensive". While Soviet planners have continually accorded lip service to productivity objectives under the rubric of "hidden production reserves", they have embraced intensive development as a major policy focus only within the past decade.
as a result, the USSR invested little into factory and machine replacement or modernization: <https://www.jec.senate.gov/reports/100th%20Congress/Gorbachev's%20Economic%20Plan%20Volume%20I%20(1438).pdf> In the mid-1970's, 56 percent of U.S. industrial investment was directed toward replacement and modernization. In the Soviet Union the proportion was only 29 percent in the late 1970's. While the U.S. proportion may be too high a standard for the Soviet Union, given slower U.S. industrial growth, some Soviet economists had recommended that the Soviet share should be doubled or tripled. The replacement share has in fact been steadily rising during the 1981-85 Five Year Plan, reaching 35 percent in 1984. [....] The advantages of an intensified replacement effort are several fold, according to special surveys carried out in the USSR. Labor productivity is said to be about 50 percent and capital productivity 86 percent higher than in new plant construction. These results reportedly were attained with cost savings of one half to two-thirds and with capacity being brought on stream 3-3.5 times as rapidly. [....] The accelerated retirement guidelines adopted in 1975, as noted earlier, have not been implemented. Official retirements for wear and tear, as reported in the annual statistical handbook, have shown no significant change. [....] During the 1970's the average age (number of years in production) of current machinery output rose significantly. The share of new products fell from 4.3 to 2.5 percent while the share of machinery in production for more than 10 years climbed from 20 to 28 percent.

# research and development: military spending prioritized
Allen 2001: military research remained innovative while civilian research fell behind: <https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3131928.pdf> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/0008-4085.00103> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/858784395535319040/allen2001.pdf> The increase in defence spending may have lowered productivity growth, however, by diverting R&D resources from civilian to military innovation. It is difficult to measure the rate of invention, but the available indicators suggest that it was declining in the USSR, at least for the civilian economy. The Soviets did publish considerable statistics on the number of new prototypes brought into use. While such numbers are always hard to interpret, Kontorovich ~1987, 1990! has argued that they indicate the volume of newly available technologies, and Amann ~1986! has pressed them into service. They show a decline in the absolute number of new inventions brought into use each year from the 1960s to 1985. Kontorovich ~1990, 267! has divided them into civilian and military innovations and argued that the fall was largely confined to the civilian sector. [....] If the Cold War was responsible for the drop in Soviet productivity growth, then it accounts for over half of the Soviet growth slowdown. TFP growth dropped from 1.5 per cent per year to 20.5 per cent between the 1960s and 1980–85. Reversing the productivity slowdown by adding 2 per cent to the 1980–85 GNP growth rate increases the latter from 2 to 4 per cent per year. This is still less than the 5.7 per cent growth of the 1960s, but certainly is a much better performance.
between 1950 and 1990, the USSR spent 10-20% of its GDP each year on defense (about 2x that of the USA): <https://nintil.com/2016/05/31/the-soviet-union-military-spending/> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/594582157100580886/defchart.png
a subsection of the Senate report on USSR underperformance mainly blamed poor managerial incentives: <https://www.jec.senate.gov/reports/100th%20Congress/Gorbachev's%20Economic%20Plan%20Volume%20I%20(1438).pdf> The explanations for lagging Soviet technological progress, with its unfavorable consequences for the policy of intensive development, lie mainly in managerial incentives, the institutio nal relationships between research and development and production, and the technological drain imposed the priority given to defense production. Technological progress in market economies depends upon both consumer and supplier initiatives. In the Soviet system, the influence of the consumer is weak, except in defense production where the initiative comes from the Ministry of Defense with reinforcement from the top leadership.
about half of research and development funds and about half of new machine tools went to the defence industry: <https://www.amazon.com/Victory-Administrations-Strategy-Hastened-Collapse/dp/0871136333> The eleventh five-year plan that was being developed by the CPSU reflected this preoccupation and concern. It gave a very high priority for overcoming the perceived lag with the West in electronics. The plan called for a rise in output of industrial robots from 13,000 to 28,000 and machine tool development centers from 2,500 to 10,700. In the first two years of the new plan, investment in engineering-sector facilities for research and development, testing, and evaluation was said to be 50 percent above the funding for the whole of the previous five years. And R&D funds were to be especially concentrated on high-tech projects. **The trouble was that the best Soviet resources in the field were being directed toward the military-industrial base. Half of the machine tools were going to defense enterprises, which also employed the best scientists. At least half of all research and development expenditures were for the military. And the Reagan defense buildup—particularly its emphasis on emerging technologies—meant that more resources needed to be shifted to defense.** [....] The temper of the times meant that Gorbachev would be devoting even more to defense than had been the case in the past. The new five-year plan called for more spending on advanced weapons. **As Gorbachev would later admit, the planned rate of growth for defense in 1986 through 1990 was almost 8 percent per year, twice the rate of national income growth.22 All told, defense expenditures would rise an astonishing 45 percent in the next five years.**

nutrition quality went up after the 1917 revolution (including collectivization), according to conscript height data: <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03017605.2016.1268454> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/540415342892285962/unknown.png For the Russian/Soviet data the actual historical trend is a matter of some dispute. Our evidence seems to support the conclusions of Allen rather than those of Wheatcroft. When two independent sources of investigation—deconvolution of adult heights on the one hand and Allen’s indices of wages and prices on the other, mutually agree, the plausibility of each is reinforced. Given however, that the deconvolution technique is new in the field, we have presented a second study using completely different data from Austria. Again we find that the inferred food availability from deconvolution conforms plausibly to other historical sources. We have come to the conclusion that it is possible to use of deconvolution to infer past diets.
from 1960 to 1985, the USSR and USA had about equal median higher caloric intake (however, as the author notes, food was more expensive and lower quality [ie, less meat and dairy] in the USSR): <https://nintil.com/2016/05/11/the-soviet-union-food/> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/562946516906409984/unknown.png

The Soviet government has not reported health status data to the World Health Organization since the early 1970s.23 There is an acknowledged coronary disease epidemic; cancer-related deaths have significantly increased; and the category of accidents, poisonings, and injuries makes up the third major cause of death.9 Significant discussion of the nature and cause of these new mortality and morbidity patterns is beclouded by the absence of current Soviet government-issued data."""
starting in the 1960's, the USSR's healthcare system was unable to handle chronic illnesses and faced systemic underfunding and shortages: <https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/73aiiu/what_was_healthcare_like_in_the_soviet_union/> <http://archive.is/qMwgJ> [W]hile the early Soviet healthcare system (early in this case largely means pre-WWII, and sometimes even pre-1930) was well prepared to deal with fractured bones and cholera, it was poorly equipped to deal with complicated conditions and mental illnesses. This approach, however, still allowed Russian (as it varied between national republics) life-expectancy to peak at or around 70 years in the mid 1960s, not far from the Western European averages at the time. This translates to around 64 years for men and 73 years for women (with the corresponding figures for France and the US in 1965 being approximately 67.5 and 66.8 for men, and 74.7 and 73.7 for women respectively). [....] From that point onward сardiovascular diseases became one of the primary causes of non-violent death in the Soviet Union. This is the trend that was noted across the industrialized world, with low rates of infectious diseases, and growing rates of cardiovascular diseases and cancer. [...] Increases in substance abuse also started to take a toll. The amount of resources devoted to healthcare did not increase accordingly (it is estimated that it stayed relatively constant at around 2-3% between 1960 and 1970). In comparison, in United States it increased from 5% in 1960, to around 8% in 1983. As a result of that, as well as the start of the decline of the Soviet economy as a whole, in the early 1970s Soviet Union became the only major industrialized nation that experienced a decline in life expectancy at that time (it fell to around 63-64 years in 1982), with an increase in the gap between males and females (an average male was expected to live around 10-12 years less than an average female at the time).

Fundamental change in gender roles and in the gender division of labour, including that in the household, was never seriously proposed (Posadskaya, 1994). Feminism remained a heresy, and the increase in quality and quantity of household goods and public services, constantly promised to Soviet women, remained a dream.""""""Formally, the Soviet wage-system was based on productivity -- schooling, skill, efficiency, and 'importance for the national economy'.

Love and pleasure had nothing to do with it. And even though Soviet women had access to abortion again after 1955, the lack of birth control and the double burden of work and family responsibilities conspired to depress sexual function in many women. There is no doubt about it: for this generation, Soviet sex sucked.""""""[They] found that middle-class urban women born between 1945 and 1965 described a marked move away from the pro-natalist script. Although the pro-natalist view of sexual relations continued, it was complemented by two new ways of talking about sexuality: romance and friendship. The emergence of the romantic script was the result of a larger shift in Soviet public narratives about sexuality.""""""This romantic script of sexuality is exactly what early socialists such as August Bebel and Alexandra Kollontai would have envisioned for a society in which economic considerations had less influence on the choice of an amorous partner."""
middle-late USSR: interviews with middle-class urban Russian women suggested that, in the late Soviet period (1965-89), the key driver for sex and relationships was romance plus friendship: <https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/11/women-better-sex-under-socialism-review> <https://u1lib.org/book/3644970/edaf3f> <https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/_3JPDwAAQBAJ> """The other way to describe sex that began to emerge among middle-class women in the late Soviet period is the friendship script. Unlike what we would call “friends with benefits” — uncommitted, recreational sex with a partner of the opposite sex — the Soviet friendship script described sex that occurred in a meaningful relationship between two people who worked together or shared a social circle, with the partners using sex as a way to show each other affection and respect. This friendship script presumably arose because women had access to their own resources and didn’t depend on men to provide for their material needs. Because some urban Soviet women felt secure in their economic position, sexuality lost its exchange value and became something to be shared."""
post-USSR: interviews with middle-class urban Russian women suggested that, after the fall of the Soviet Union (1991-2005), sex was re-commodified and re-coupled with material gains: <https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/11/women-better-sex-under-socialism-review> <https://u1lib.org/book/3644970/edaf3f> <https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/_3JPDwAAQBAJ> """If sexual economics theory is on the right track, you would guess that the introduction of free markets and the rapid dismantling of the social welfare state after the collapse of the USSR would precipitate a return of a worldview in which women’s sexuality is once again a commodity. And this is exactly what Temkina and Zdravomyslova found in their 1997 and 2005 interviews with women of the post-Soviet generation. In addition to the “hedonistic script,” in which sex is purely physical for the purpose of experiencing individual pleasure, often assisted by sex toys and other products that can be purchased in a capitalist economy (a script absent, for obvious reasons, in the Soviet era), they note the emergence of something they called the “instrumental script,” which became ubiquitous after the advent of free markets.""""""The commodification of women’s sexuality in Russia could be observed in the dramatic increase in sex work, pornography, strategic marriages for money, and what the authors call “sponsorship,” whereby wealthy men sponsor their mistresses.

In the middle run the new model was proven, in Europe and China, to be almost as resilient as the Western democratic forms, although less efficient for some social and economic purposes. The largely peaceful, post-1990 transformations of Soviet states to more liberal democratic forms of governance appears to authenticate the democratic, normative element in this model and its influence on the quality of authority transition."""

However, collectivization pushed up the growth rate enough in the rest of the decade to raise GDP, capital accumulation, and consumption above the 1939 levels they would have realized had the agrarian system of the 1920s been preserved. Collectivization raised growth by increasing rural-urban migration: First, low procurement prices lowered farm incomes below the level they would have otherwise reached. Migration increased in consequence, since it was a function of the ratio of urban to rural income. Second, the deportation of 'kulaks' and state terrorism in general increased the rate of rural-urban migration at every ratio of urban to rural consumption. Terrorism increased economic growth to that small degree."""

The working arrangements of all economic systems rely on incentives and norms of behaviour. The Bolshevik Revolution destroyed the old incentives and norms and struggled to replace them with new ones. Private property was confscated in successive waves from the Revolution of 1917 to the collectivisation of peasant farms, launched at the end of 1929. The waves of confscation destroyed incentives to work, to save, and to innovate. The famine of the early 1930s arose from the interplay of unexpectedly poor weather with the confscation of grain stocks to meet the needs of industrialisation. Famine and the repression that accompanied it, destroyed millions of lives. Later in the 1930s, the purges arose from the party leaders’ need to secure their regime and from Stalin’s calculation that the greatest danger to the regime arose from the ‘potential’ and even ‘unconscious’ enemies that were hiding around him and more widely in society. The purges also destroyed millions of lives by mass killing and ruined further millions by condemning the victims not killed at once to forced resettlement and slave labour.

It is tempting to conclude that this was due to the removal of key fgures: Pyatakov in heavy industry, Lifshits on the railways, and Mar’yasin at Gosbank. In each case the arrest of the key fgure was accompanied by a wave of arrests of their offcials.40 The less successful performance of the economy continued in the following years. The waves of arrests led to a pronounced shortage of qualifed and experienced personnel and were closely accompanied and followed by a deterioration in economic performance.41 In the coal industry, arrests of senior personnel were so extensive in the frst few months of 1937 that in March the deputy head of the Commissariat of Heavy Industry’s Chief Coal Administration complained to his superiors of the ‘complete collapse of work’ in the mine construction trust Shakhtostroi. Two months later he complained that no work had been done in the trust for fve months because the whole board of the trust had been arrested.42 Arrests were widespread throughout the industry.

The level of mechanization and, more generally, working conditions, however, were very different, complicating such comparisons. Accounting for possible externalities of forced labor would make such cost-benefit analyses of forced labor even more complex (Gregory and Lazarev, eds, 2003).

In 1931 Stalin purged and executed most of the planning experts, such as Kondratiev, Chayanov, Groman, Ginzberg, Rubin et al., branding them as Menshevik counterrevolutionaries. [...] Stalin himself discarded *The Balance of the National Economy of the USSR, 1923–24* as just “juggling with figures” (Stalin, 1954a: 178), signaling the physical termination of planning specialists. Ironically, the so-called Stalinist planned economy was born on the corpses of almost all the contemporary Marxist planners.

Focusing on the different economic and bureaucratic cultures within the industrial system, Shearer reconstructs the debates in 1928 and 1929 over administrative, financial, and commercial reform. He uses information from recently opened archives to show that attempts by the state's trading organizations to create a commercial economy enjoyed wide support, offering a model that combined planning and rapid industrialization with social democracy and economic prosperity. In an effort to crush the syndicate movement and establish tight political control over the economy, Stalinist leaders intervened with a program of radical reforms. Shearer demonstrates that professional engineers, planners and industrial administrators in many cases actively supported the creation of a powerful industrial state unhampered by domestic social and economic constraints. The paradoxical result, Shearer shows, was a loss of control. The overly centralized system that emerged during the first Five-Year Plan was rendered incoherent by periodic economic crises and the continuing influence of partially suppressed social and market forces."""

The evidence of these registration figures inclines me to revise my position and to suggest that the scale of mortality from the 1932/33 famine may have been somewhat larger than I had earlier suggested and might be as high as 4 to 5 million. These figures are much lower than many of the excess mortality and population loss figures that are cited in the West. Mace believes that 5-7 million for the Ukraine alone is a 'conservative figure',23 Conquest claims 5 million Ukrainian famine deaths, and 8 million overall including the North Caucasus and Kaza- khstan; but on top of this he wishes to add another 6.5 million deaths 'as a result of dekulakization'.24 The figures given by Mace and Conquest are impossible to accept.

Tauger 2001: both weather and collectivization played a substantial role in the Holodomor: Tauger lists 13 causes for the 1933 famines: extreme drought, a sudden midwinter warm spell, heavy rains late in the growing season, rust (plant disease), smut (plant disease), ergot (plant disease), pests, mass killing of draft forces (horses) without compensatory increases in tractors, peasant exile and reduced labor, peasant opposition to collectivization, soil exhaustion, weeds, and mice: <https://carlbeckpapers.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/cbp/article/view/89> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/871934431961698334/tauger2001.pdf> 
Tauger 2001: famines occurred under the NEP, before collectivization: <https://carlbeckpapers.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/cbp/article/view/89> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/871934431961698334/tauger2001.pdf> Serious droughts led to famines during the period of the New Economic Policy (NEP) in 1924 -- 1925 in European Russia and Ukraine, and in 1928-1929, which was most severe in Ukraine. In both cases, the regime acknowledged the crises and formed extraordinary agencies to manage relief.16 The 1928-1929 Ukrainian famine, which has not been recognized in the Western literature but is documented in Ukrainian sources, was a major cause of the "grain crisis" because it substantially reduced grain supplies for the urban population as well as for peasants in the drought regions. The grain crisis and famine of 1928-1929 were among the main factors that led Soviet leaders and officials to resort to the "extraordinary measures" to procure food from peasants in other regions, to import food from abroad, to ration food in towns and in rural famine districts, and ultimately to undertake the collectivization of agriculture.17 Even in 1930 many regions had unfavorable weather and crop failures: in parts of the North Caucasus, crop failures forced local authorities to appeal to central authorities for seed aid, which they received, and crop failures also reduced harvests in Kazakstan and the Middle Volga.18

# exports: the ussr reduced grain exports
the USSR curtailed exports, urban rations, and rural rations (Tauger 1991): <https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/C5FC508259E11A70BFBFA5AE5A2C4E9F/S0037677900000863a.pdf/1932_harvest_and_the_famine_of_1933.pdf> <http://sci-hub.se/10.2307/2500600> The low 1932 harvest meant that the regime did not have sufficient grain for urban and rural food supplies, seed, and exports. The authorities curtailed all of these, but ultimately rural food supplies had last priority. The harsh 1932-1933 procurements only displaced the famine from urban areas, which would have suffered a similar scale of mortality without the grain the procurements provided (though, as noted above, urban mortality rates also rose in 1933). **The severity and geographical extent of the famine, the sharp decline in exports in 1932-1933, seed requirements, and the chaos in the Soviet Union in these years, all lead to the conclusion that even a complete cessation of exports would not have been enough to prevent famine. This situation makes it difficult to accept the interpretation of the famine as the result of the 1932 grain procurements and as a conscious act of genocide. The harvest of 1932 essentially made a famine inevitable. Although the low 1932 harvest may have been a mitigating circumstance, the regime was still responsible for the deprivation and suffering of the Soviet population in the early 1930s.** The data presented here provide a more precise measure of the consequences of collectivization and forced industrialization than has previously been available; if anything, these data show that the effects of those policies were worse than has been assumed. They also, however, indicate that the famine was real, the result of a failure of economic policy, of the "revolution from above," rather than of a "successful" nationality policy against Ukrainians or other ethnic groups.

The actual amounts of grain needed and utilized for this purpose can only be approximated.""""""As can be seen from comparing these statistics with the data on procurements in tables 1 and 2, the total of supply and exports nearly exhausts the total grain available from procurements in these years. The Soviet government did have small reserves of grain, but continually drew these down to allocate food to the population.5 Since virtually the entire country experienced shortages of food, indicating that the procurement and distribution data are reasonably accurate, clearly the Soviet Union faced a severe shortage, and the most important cause of that shortage has to have been small harvests in 1931 and 1932.""""""Internationally, Soviet leaders faced a military threat in the Far East that had resulted from the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, an extremely tense situation in Germany as the Nazi party rose to power, distrustful relations with Poland, and a serious balance of payments deficit that put the Soviet Union under intense pressure to export commodities and to curtail imports of producer goods, both desperately needed internally."""

Afterward, when most peasants had already been collectivized and subjected to the procurement demands of 1931, the number of draft animals, especially horses, declined rapidly. Animals were the immediate victims of shortages in 1930-1933 since starving peasants had no choice but to feed themselves first from the dwindling reserves, and because peasants frequently expressed their resentment of collectivization by neglect and abusive treatment of socialized livestock.93"""

# grain stocks: excessively large, but not enormous
the USSR was unable to maintain large grain stocks: <https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/slavic-review/article/stalin-grain-stocks-and-the-famine-of-19321933/3359EB3EEF22890B969720BEE5BDF9A7> <https://sci-hub.se/10.2307/2501740> """All planners' stocks-the two secret grain reserves, Nepfond and Mobfond or Gosfond, together with "transitional stocks" held by grain organizations-amounted on 1 July 1933 to less than 2 million tons (1.997 million tons, according to the highest official figure""""""On 1 July 1933 the total amount of grain set aside in reserve grain stocks (fondy) amounted not to 4.53 million tons as Conquest claimed but to only 1.141 million.""""""These findings do not, of course, free Stalin from responsibility for the famine. It is difficult, perhaps impossible, to assess the extent to which it would have been possible for Stalin to use part of the grain stocks available in spring 1933 to feed starving peasants. The state was a monopoly supplier of grain to urban areas and the army; if the reserves of this monopoly supply system-which amounted to four-six weeks' supply-were to have been drained, mass starvation, epidemics and unrest in the towns could have resulted. Nevertheless, it seems certain that, if Stalin had risked lower levels of these reserves in spring and summer 1933, hundreds of thousands-perhaps millions-of lives could have been saved. In the slightly longer term, if he had been open about the famine, some international help would certainly have alleviated the disaster. And if he had been more far-sighted, the agricultural crisis of 1932-1933 could have been mitigated and perhaps even avoided altogether. But Stalin was not hoarding immense grain reserves in these years. On the contrary, he had failed to reach the levels which he had been imperatively demanding since 1929."""

# ethnicities affected: probably not intentionally biased towards ukrainian death
Ukraine's mortality rate in 1933 was 189% higher than in 32, Russia's 51.7%, Byelorussia's 23.6%, and the USSR as a whole 83.9%: <https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/152086.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/589912399083995149/unknown.png
Stanislav Kulchytsky and Hennadiy Yefimenko state that the statistical distribution of famine's victims among the ethnicities closely reflects the ethnic distribution of the rural population of Ukraine. The more-rural Moldavian, Polish, German, and Bulgarian populations of Ukraine suffered in the same proportion as the rural Ukrainian population, while the more-urban Russians and Jews survived the famine more successfully: <http://web.archive.org/web/20191031134756/http://resource.history.org.ua/cgi-bin/eiu/history.exe?C21COM=2&I21DBN=ELIB&P21DBN=ELIB&Image_file_name=book/0002027.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/641685664634765334/unknown.png """Статистика смертності в національному розрізі за 1933 р. виглядає таким чином: Аналізуючи цю таблицю, слід пам'ятати, що в ній подається як природна смертність, так і смертність від толоду. Спрямований проти українського села терор голодом захопив усіх, хто проживав у ньому. У формах звітності за національною ознакою була зареєстрована більша кількість смертей, ніж у формах природного руху (1850,3 тис. чоловік). Частка українців серед загиблих приблизно відповідає їх питомій вазі у сільському населенні республіки. Молдавське, польське, німецьке і болгарське населення майже повністю проживало в селах. Тому воно постраждало від голоду в таких же пропорціях, як українці. Євреї мешкали більшою частиною у містах. Тому смертність серед них мало відрізнялася від нормальної. Переважна більшість росіян теж проживала в містах. Серед порівняно нечисленного населення в російських селах зареєстрована основна частина померлих. Треба прийняти до уваги, що облік смертності в містах майже не зазнав деформацій і тому був відносно повним. Навпаки, в селах органи ЗАГС спромоглися зареєструвати менше половини смертних випадків. Все це вказує на те, що терор голодом цілив своїм вістрям не в етнічних українців, а в сільське населення."""

# historical context: mutual defense treaty
the USSR had signed a mutual defense treaty with France; instead, in 1938, France supported the Munich agreement: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Soviet_Treaty_of_Mutual_Assistance> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czechoslovakia%E2%80%93Soviet_Union_relations> <http://www.forost.ungarisches-institut.de/pdf/19350516-1.pdf> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_Agreement>
between April and August 1939, the USSR attempted to establish tripartite mutual defense treaty with Britain and France. Suspicion of socialism and belief that war could be avoided prevented the West from taking the talks seriously; in addition, Poland refused to allow Soviet troops through its territory. After a long failure of the talks, the USSR pursued a non-aggresion treaty with Germany: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Polish_military_alliance#Franco-British_failed_alliance_with_Moscow> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop_Pact> <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09668139308412091> <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/713663077>

We have data to the effect that some 86,582 people perished in prisons between 1939 and 1951.31 (We do not yet know exactly how many died in labor colonies.) We also know that, between 1930 and 1952-1953, 786,098 "counterrevolutionaries" were executed (or, according to another source, more than 775,866 persons "on cases of the police" and for "political crimes").32 Finally, we know that, from 1932 through 1940, 389,521 peasants died in places of "kulak" resettlement.33 Adding these figures together would produce a total of a little more than 2.3 million, but this can in no way be taken as an exact number. First of all, there is a possible overlap between the numbers given for GULAG camp deaths and "political" executions as well as between the latter and other victims of the 1937-1938 mass purges and perhaps also other categories falling under police jurisdiction. Double-counting would deflate the 2.3 million figure. On the other hand, the 2.3 million does not include several suspected categories of death in custody. It does not include, for example, deaths among deportees during and after the war as well as among categories of exiles other than "kulaks."34 Still, we have some reason to believe that the new numbers for GULAG and prison deaths, executions as well as deaths in peasant exile, are likely to bring us within a much narrower range of error than the estimates proposed by the majority of authors who have written on the subject.

Generally speaking, the first stop for an arrested person was a prison, where an investigation and interrogation led to conviction or, more rarely, release.7 After sentencing, most victims were sent to one of the labor camps or colonies to serve their terms.

A maximum camp death rate is calculated which includes recorded deaths, uncaptured runaways and disappearances in transit. Not all of these categories would cover deaths, but many would. The data are fairly systematically presented for the period after 1934, when the camps were placed under the control of NKVD, but before 1934 during the OGPU period, when the level of mortality and losses through runaways was much higher, the data are far less complete.

[....] Scholars have been justifiably cautious when using this data. Internal Gulag records are often inconsistent. Both the medical-sanitation department and the accounting and distribution department kept records on inmate deaths, and their figures do not coincide. Deaths during transport did not get included in the official record.97 [97. Khlevniuk, History of the Gulag, 321–327.] Thus an accurate accounting of mortality in Stalin’s Gulag is enormously difficult to produce. The mortality rate most used in offi cial documents captured only deaths that occurred in Gulag medical facilities. In February 1933, Gulag chief Berman and Gulag medical-sanitation department chief Ginzburg complained that camp medical-sanitation departments were failing to record deaths that did not take place in their facilities.99 By the mid-1930s, deaths both in- and outside camp clinics and hospitals were reported. For 1935, Bamlag reported 5954 deaths in health care facilities and 998 outside them, for a total of 6952, or roughly 4 percent of its average prisoner population for the year.100"""
^ Healey 2018 review of Alexopolous 2017: Alexopolous arrives at a "conservative" death toll of 6 million (of 18 million inmates) by counting all released prisoners except the most healthy as soon-to-die: <https://academic.oup.com/ahr/article-abstract/123/3/1049/5025385> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/ahr/123.3.1049> """Finally and most provocatively, Alexopoulos proposes a “conservative” death toll for the Gulag of at least 6 million “given the archival record on [prisoners’] ‘physical labor capability’” (243). Methodologically, this claim is in ferred from this one indicator, and Alexopoulos interprets “physical labor capability” assuming the very worst for all prisoners but those classed as healthiest. Thus, she extends the camps’ mortality rate to encompass those whose lives were shortened by Gulag toil (244), a laudable moral choice, but one with obvious methodological difficulties. How do we decide which “deaths after release” to include? If it were possible to obtain it, substantiation from local and regional sources for such a count would be needed. The central records can only hint at the phenomenon."""

# forced labor: most were not criminals
Getty 1993: a minority of GULAG forced laborers were criminals: just 20.6% in 1934, 27.8% in 1936, and 17.3% in 1940 were sentenced for a crime, and just 4.7% in 1934, 5.5% in 1936, and 5.2% in 1940 for a "crime against persons"  <https://academic.oup.com/ahr/article-abstract/98/4/1017/126966> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1086/ahr/98.4.1017> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/855104448186548264/getty1993.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/855118189070909450/unknown.png It is commonly believed that most of the prisoners of the "Gulag Archipelago" had been arrested and sentenced for political offenses falling under one of the headings of "counterrevolutionary offenses" (Article 58 in the criminal code). It is also common wisdom that many people arrested for other reasons were accused of political crimes for propaganda value. The available evidence does not bear out this view, but it does suggest considerable ambiguity in definitions of "political crimes." Table 7 shows the breakdown of labor camp inmates for selected years, according to the offense for which they were sentenced. Although the presence of alleged counterrevolutionaries is impressive, it turns out that ostensibly non-political detainees heavily outnumbered "politicals."

# dekulakization
Wheatcroft 1996: between 1932 and 1940, a minimum of 402 thousand (recorded by Soviet security services) and maximum of 818 thousand (also including uncaptured runaways) people died in Soviet 'special settlements' (mostly resettlement sites for dekulakization): <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09668139608412415> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1080/09668139608412415> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/854781720234557441/wheatcroft1996.pdf> XXXXX after adjusting for civilian death rates: minimum 210 thousand, maximum 576 thousand

The first group amongst these were probably the Koreans who were forceably removed from the Russian Far East in 1937.45 A few years later the category was greatly increased to include deportations and executions associated with the occupation of the Baltic States and Eastern Poland between 1939 and 1941. At the beginning of the war, on 28 August 1941, the Supreme Soviet of the USSR ordered the ethnic Germans from the Volga area to be be forceably exiled to the Novosibirsk, Omsk and Altai regions and to Kazakhstan.46 Later during the war other nationalities were deported from newly liberated areas; these included the Kalmyks (26 359 families of 93 139 persons in October 1943), the Karachai (14 774 families of 69 938 persons in November 1943), the Chechen and Ingush (450 000 persons in February 1944) and the Tartars from Crimea. The main nationalities still held in the places of special exile in October 1946 are listed in Table 8. Unfortunately, so far data have not been made available to allow mortality rates amongst these later, primarily ethnic, spetspereselentsy to be calculated.

This includes most of the dekulakization operations in category 2 and 3 carried out in 1930–1. It was only the more serious category 1 kulaks who were to be tried individually in an extrajudicial manner and sentenced. These unfortunate beings were the only kulaks to be included in these records of the investigative organs. Similarly most of the exiles of ethnic groups from certain areas were to be performed without the use of the investigative organs, as were the Katyn executions. It should be noted, however, that the mass arrests and executions of the Anti-Soviet Element campaign 00447, and the ethnic campaigns of 1937–8 were all supposed to be carried out with the use of individual investigations from the investigative agencies, and in that sense they were not mass operations, and would be included in these records."""

The claims that these data are clearly false because they fail to include all dekulakised kulaks, or the Katyn killings are invalid. Category 2 and 3 kulaks in 1930 and 1931 were ordered to be exiled without referring their cases to the investigative organs. And the Polish officers and intellectuals in 1940 were similarly processed and shot on the basis of the documents used for their arrest, without further investigations. [....] The only Security force data that we have are for cases passing through the investigative organs. We do not have any data for extrajudicial executions carried out without the involvement of the investigative agencies. These were mass operations in a specific sense in which sentences were imposed after arrest without further investigation. These were relatively rare cases during peacetime, but more regular in martial law circumstances, and in newly occupied areas. The Katyn massacre of 25,000 Polish officers and members of the intelligentsia in 1940 belongs to this category."

This rather misses the point of a report and a speech. Both would extend to unwieldy length were they to address every detail. Furr also fails to recognize the impossibility of proving a negative. How can one confirm that the outlandish charges made against Rudzutak were false? Can one prove that an individual did not commit sabotage, for example? It is more meaningful to note the total lack of evidence in support of the charges."""

Furr confirms that Yezhov had many innocent people tortured and killed, but says that Stalin blamed Yezhov and quotes him as describing Yezhov as a “scoundrel” who “ruined our best cadres” (304). After the arrest of Yezhov for his excesses, the total number of arrests and executions dropped sharply. Although the scale paled in comparison to 1937–38, there were still nearly 169,000 individuals arrested in 1939–40. This hardly constituted an end to repression.""""""It is too much to suppose that Stalin could not have seen anything amiss until the end of 1938, had he not set the repression in motion and looked favorably upon its progression. Otherwise, it would have been impossible to overlook the fact that the majority of his comrades in the Central Committee were being arrested and killed, with each accusation more improbable than the last. Nor could he have overlooked more than 1.5 million arrests and nearly 700,000 executions in the period 1937–38. The arrest of Yezhov had more to do with a policy change and a shifting of blame, than with a sluggish dawning of recognition."""

east germany grew as quickly as west germany did (p.53): <https://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/bitstream/handle/document/28587/ssoar-hsrsupp-2009-no_21-heske-volkswirtschaftliche_gesamtrechnung_ddr_1950-1989.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/640208079396274197/unknown.png

# growth: reparations
reparations were extremely expensive: <http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-5098.html> The reorientation and restructuring of the East German economy would have been difficult in any case. The substantial reparations costs that the Soviet Union imposed on its occupation zone, and later on East Germany, made the process even more difficult. Payments continued into the early 1950s, ending only with the death of Stalin. According to Western estimates, these payments amounted to about 25 percent of total East German production through 1953.

# sexuality
women in East Germany reported substantially higher sexual satisfaction than West Germany: <https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/11/women-better-sex-under-socialism-review> <https://u1lib.org/book/3644970/edaf3f> <https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/_3JPDwAAQBAJ> """In 1988, Kurt Starke and Ulrich Clement conducted the first comparative study of the self-reported sexual experiences of East and West German female students. They found that the East German women said they enjoyed sex more and reported a higher rate of orgasm than their Western counterparts. In 1990, another study comparing the sexual attitudes of youth in the two Germanys found that GDR men’s and women’s preferences were more in sync with each other than those of young men and women in the West. For example, one survey found that 73 percent of East German women and 74 percent of East German men wanted to get married. In contrast, 71 percent of women in the West desired marriage, but only 57 percent of Western men did, a fourteen-point difference. A different survey about sexual experiences uncovered much higher levels of self-reported sensual enjoyment among East German women. When asked if their last tryst had left them feeling satisfied, 75 percent of GDR women and 74 percent of GDR men said yes, compared to 84 percent of FRG men and a mere 46 percent of FRG women. Finally, respondents were asked to report whether they felt “happy” after sex. Among the East German women 82 percent agreed, whereas among West German women only 52 percent reported feeling “happy.” To reverse that statistic, only 18 percent of GDR females were not “happy” after sex, compared to almost half of the surveyed females in the FRG."""

Most of the increased revenue was a result of the nationalization and associated policy changes, including a doubling of production by 2013. 9

Deposits have grown at an average yearly rate of 14 percent (between 2008 and 2019) even with a relative slowdown in the last couple of years (5.9 percent in 2018 and 3.4 percent year-over-year as of June 2019).19 [....] Directed lending for productive sectors and low interest rate ceilings are part of the toolkit successfully deployed by the monetary authorities.21 Total credit in the financial system has grown at an average of 16 percent per year since 2008.22

# deficit spending
deficit spending has increased, but is relatively small: <http://cepr.net/press-center/press-releases/new-report-reviews-changes-in-bolivia-s-economy-under-evo-morales-s-presidency> <http://cepr.net/images/stories/reports/bolivia-macro-2019-10.pdf> <http://web.archive.org/web/20191113010826/http://cepr.net/images/stories/reports/bolivia-macro-2019-10.pdf> Bolivia’s government budget deficit averaged just 1.5 percent of GDP annually between 2006 and 2018. However, between 2015 and 2018, the average annual budget deficit grew to 7.5 percent of GDP; on average, 4.3 percentage points of the deficit were financed internally by the Central Bank.26 From 2005 to 2017, the Bolivian government increased social spending by 80 percent in real terms.

# social spending
social spending has enormously increased: <http://cepr.net/press-center/press-releases/new-report-reviews-changes-in-bolivia-s-economy-under-evo-morales-s-presidency> <http://cepr.net/images/stories/reports/bolivia-macro-2019-10.pdf> <http://web.archive.org/web/20191113010826/http://cepr.net/images/stories/reports/bolivia-macro-2019-10.pdf> Since 2000, Bolivia has the highest rate of public investment, as a percent of GDP, in the region.24 While acknowledging its positive macroeconomic effects, the IMF has criticized the efficiency of Bolivia’s public investment in terms of outcomes per dollar spent.25 In the last few years, Bolivia’s public sector deficit has increased substantially due to high public investment in the context of less favorable terms of trade. [....] Bolivia’s government has directed large amounts of resources to social spending, especially cash transfers targeted toward vulnerable sectors of the population. The three most important transfer programs are Juancito Pinto, a grant to families with children that is designed to incentivize children’s school attendance; Juana Azurduy, which gives funds to uninsured new mothers as an incentive for them to seek medical care during and after their pregnancies, in order to reduce maternal and infant mortality; and Renta Dignidad, which provides grants for those over the age of 60. These cash transfer programs translate into increased consumer spending and sustained reduction of extreme poverty. In 2018, 5.8 million Bolivians — 51.8 percent of the population — received a direct government cash transfer.29 [....] However, it is arguable that the government could have done even more for the poor. As a percent of GDP, social spending actually decreased between 2005 and 2013, though it has since risen to 12.7 percent of GDP, up from 12.4 percent of GDP in 2005.30

# purchasing power
real incomes have substantially risen: <http://cepr.net/press-center/press-releases/new-report-reviews-changes-in-bolivia-s-economy-under-evo-morales-s-presidency> <http://cepr.net/images/stories/reports/bolivia-macro-2019-10.pdf> <http://web.archive.org/web/20191113010826/http://cepr.net/images/stories/reports/bolivia-macro-2019-10.pdf> The consistent increase in Bolivians’ purchasing power via increased employment, higher real wages, and government transfers has contributed to reducing the poverty rate (as measured by income). The poverty rate is below 35 percent (down from 60 percent in 2006), and the extreme poverty rate is 15.2 percent (down from 37.7 percent in 2006).35

# not socialist: investment
discussion of investment and socialism in Venezuela: <https://thenextrecession.wordpress.com/2017/08/03/the-tragedy-of-venezuela/> """What went wrong with the laudable aims of Chavismo? Could this tragedy been avoided? Well, yes, if the Chavista revolution had not stopped at less than halfway, leaving the economy still predominantly in the control of capital. Instead, the Chavista and Maduro governments relied on high oil prices and huge oil reserves to reduce poverty, while failing to transform the economy through productive investment, state ownership and planning. Between 1999 and 2012 the state had an income of $383bn from oil, due not only to the improvement in prices, but also to the increase in the royalties paid by the transnationals. However, this income was not used transform the productive sectors of the economy. Yes, some was used to improve the living standards of the most impoverished masses. But there was no plan for investment and growth. Venezuelan capital was allowed to get on with it – or not as the case may be. Indeed, the share of industry in GDP fell from 18% of GDP in 1998 to 14% in 2012."""

# food
report: <http://cepr.net/blogs/the-americas-blog/the-media-venezuela-and-hunger-statistics-a-case-study-in-careless-reporting> US newspapers and journals often attribute their Venezuelan hunger figures to “a recent survey … by the country’s leading universities.” The survey in question was published on February 27, 2016 by Simón Bolívar University, the Central University of Venezuela, and the Bengoa Foundation. The report, which focuses on Venezuelan nutrition, is part of an annual review covering the state of living conditions in the country. Maritza Landaeta-Jiménez, who as recently as 2013 was a member of the Venezuelan opposition’s Nutrition Commission, headed the 2016 research. **The document, based on a survey of 6,413 Venezuelans, reported that 93 percent of Venezuelans felt that they did not have enough money to purchase food, and that 72.7 percent of Venezuelans had lost an average of 8.7 kilograms (19 pounds) in the past year. However, the same survey revealed that 67.5 percent of Venezuelans were eating three meals a day, and only 25 percent of the country felt that their nutrition could be categorized as “deficient.”**
shortages: <https://nacla.org/news/2016/11/03/hunger-venezuela-look-beyond-headlines> When Venezuelan economist and Universidad Simón Bolívar professor Pasqualina Curcio put these claims to the test in her extensive investigation of the country’s current economic situation, she had some interesting findings. First, several of the missing products have not been regulated since 2010, and among those that are regulated, the government has raised prices in an effort to incentivize distributors several times recently, but this has not resulted in increased availability. Second, the shortages began to intensify in 2013, before oil prices plummeted and while dollars were still readily available. Even once oil prices dropped and dollars became less available, the government continued to prioritize dollars for food import, and by their own accounting, the production levels of Venezuela’s major food companies have been stable or have even increased in that time. Curcio also found a correlation between intensity of food shortages and politically important moments, such as the lead-up to elections. Could it be that the shortages are manufactured? Many food sovereignty activists see it as no coincidence that Polar, the country’s largest food company, responsible for many of the items missing from shelves, is owned by a well-known member of the political opposition to the government.

food security data in detail: http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/ess-fs/ess-fadata/en/ (see metadata sheets)
food balance sheets data: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/CC
food security methodology: <http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/ess-fs/fs-methods/fs-methods1/en/> Parameters to characterize the distribution of food consumption employed to estimate the PoU are derived from different sources. To compute per mean or per capita DEC at a national level, FAO relies on Food Balance Sheets. The latest data from this source refer to 2011; therefore, additional sources were needed to estimate the DEC for the last 3 years, from 2012-14. The main source for 2012 and 2013 estimates were projections prepared by the Trade and Market Division of FAO. The Holt-Winters distributed lag model was instead used to project the DEC for 2014. In some cases, the same model was applied to compute projections also for 2012 and 2013, when data from the Trade and Market Division were not available. The Holt-Winters model uses a process known as exponential smoothing, which attributes higher weights to the more recent data and progressively less weight to the older observations. Weights decrease in each period by a constant amount, which lies on an exponential curve. For countries showing peculiar patterns, other simpler forecasting models were used, such as linear or exponential trends.
food balance methodology: http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/X9892E/X9892e01.htm#P78_13383 Food balance sheets are assembled form a variety of sources. The quality of the balance sheets and their coverage vary considerably among countries and commodities. Inaccuracies and errors may be introduced at each stage of a balance sheet's construction. The user of these data must therefore bear in mind their limitations. Ideally, the basic data required for the preparation of food balance sheets should be obtained from the same source. This implies that, firstly, the country should have a comprehensive statistical system which records all current information relating to each component of the food balance sheet (starting from producers to consumers). Secondly, concepts of the information adopted should be those of the food balance sheet concepts. Thirdly, the information available should be consistent, at least with respect to measurement unit and time reference period. In practice, however, such an ideal statistical system does not exist. Even in the few, mainly developed, countries which possess uncommonly sophisticated reporting procedures, the available data do not always meet either the second or third condition. Therefore, in practice, the basic data are necessarily based on a large variety of sources. The main sources commonly used are discussed below. Production and trade data are part of the ongoing national official statistics. They are based either on direct enquiries or records, or are estimated by Government agencies. Information on stock changes is available from marketing authorities and factories or from farmer stock surveys. Information on industrial uses are obtained from industrial/manufacturing censuses/surveys. Feed and seeding rates are obtained from cost of production surveys or are estimated by the Government agencies concerned. Losses occurring in industrial processing are also obtained from manufacturing surveys.

1998 Presidential election: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Venezuelan_presidential_election>
1998 election, Carter Center: <https://www.cartercenter.org/news/documents/doc874.html> <https://www.cartercenter.org/documents/1151.pdf> Overall, the Council of Freely Elected Heads of Government observers expressed enthusiasm about the election process and were impressed by the technology involved in the automation of the vote. Problems were reported in only 16 of 252 voting sites visited, and most of these would not affect the results of the elections. The delegates found voters, poll workers, party witnesses, and soldiers worked together harmoniously to make this a transparent and peaceful election that clearly reflected the will of the Venezuelan people.
2000 Presidential + National Assembly election: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Venezuelan_general_election>
2000 election, Carter Center: <https://www.cartercenter.org/news/documents/doc1013.html> <https://www.cartercenter.org/documents/297.pdf> We congratulate the Venezuelan people for their enthusiastic participation in yesterday´s elections. We are extremely impressed with citizens´ desire to exercise their right to vote and commend them on their patience and peacefulness. Our delegates found political party witnesses in almost all voting sites, representing a variety of parties at the national and local levels. In addition, the voting table workers had the basic knowledge necessary, worked diligently to instruct the voters on properly completing the ballots, and strived to overcome the difficulties of this complicated election process.
2000 election, Organization of American States: <http://www.oas.org/sap/publications/2000/moe/venezuela/pbl_30_2000_eng.pdf> The election campaign was conducted in an overall framework of freedom of expression, pluralism, and a high degree of public participation, fostered by the diversity of candidates, party backed and independent, and by the efforts of campaigners to mobilize the public, at the national as well as at the state and municipal levels.

The sample was analyzed, and it does not have different properties than the universe. The sample generation program was analyzed as part of the 2nd audit process and again in this study. Both studies showed that the sample does not operate on a subset of the universe, thus hiding or masquerading some of the properties of the universe. Consequently the results of the 2nd audit accurately confirm the electoral results of Aug. 15.

2007 constitutional referendum: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Venezuelan_constitutional_referendum>
2007 constitutional referendum, Carter Center: <https://www.cartercenter.org/news/pr/venezuela_120307.html> Venezuelan citizens responded on Dec. 2 in a peaceful and orderly way to the referendum convoked by the National Electoral Council (CNE) to approve or reject the proposal to reform the National Constitution, presented to the citizens by the government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. With 90 percent of the vote counted, the CNE declared the referendum defeated, and immediately thereafter President Hugo Chávez Frías accepted the results on national television.

2012 Presidential election: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Venezuelan_presidential_election>
2012 Presidential election, Carter Center: <https://www.cartercenter.org/resources/pdfs/news/peace_publications/election_reports/venezuela-2012-election-study-mission-final-rpt.pdf> The 2012 presidential elections in Venezuela won by Hugo Rafael Chávez Frías reflected and reinforced the intense political contestation and social polarization Venezuelans have grown accustomed to since Chávez was first elected to the presidency in December 1998. Fortunately, tensions did not boil over and voting took place peacefully amid the high stakes election on Oct. 7, 2012. [....] Even so, isolated claims of fraud surfaced after the vote. Nevertheless, the whole opposition leadership, including, most importantly, Capriles himself, unequivocally rejected those claims, stating that the results reflected the will of the electorate. [....] Because the Center did not have an election observation mission in Venezuela, this report is not a comprehensive assessment of the quality of the electoral process as a whole. The report is based on the interviews conducted, the reports of national observer organizations, an analysis of Venezuelan laws and regulations, and a digest of personal observations from a nine-month monitoring period.
2013 Presidential election: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Venezuelan_presidential_election>
2013 Presidential election, Carter Center: <https://www.cartercenter.org/news/pr/venezuela-070313.html> <https://www.cartercenter.org/resources/pdfs/news/peace_publications/election_reports/venezuela-final-rpt-2013-elections.pdf> As the high turnout and many opinion polls demonstrate, the Venezuelan population, and the political parties and candidates in gene	ral, have confidence in the performance and integrity of the automated touch-screen voting machines. As the postelection citizen verification audits of 100 percent of the voting machines demonstrated, the automated system functioned as expected in recording the votes cast, transmitting, and counting them on April 14. There was not agreement, however, about the quality of the voting conditions and guarantees that every registered voter is able to vote one time, and only one time. In stark comparison to the October election, when the Capriles campaign and the MUD opposition coalition questioned the conditions of competition, after the April election they also questioned the conditions of voting, a heightened criticism that went to the heart of the system’s legitimacy.

Jimmy Carter, 2012: <http://web.archive.org/web/20120923221123/http://cartercenter.org/news/multimedia/Conversations/30-years-of-the-carter-center.html> https://youtu.be/VPKPw4t6Sic?t=2629 Some of the problems that John mentioned are serious, but I think the elections in Venezuela;  although some people have criticized the result, which is Hugo Chavez having won. There is no doubt in my mind, having monitored very closely the election process, that he won fairly and squarely.  As a matter of fact, of the 92 elections we've monitored, I would say the election process in Venezuela is the best in the world.

# media
from 2000 to 2010, government media averaged just 3% audience share: <http://cepr.net/documents/publications/2010_12_venezuela_media.pdf> As can be seen from the table, as of September 2010, Venezuelan state TV channels had just a 5.4 percent audience share. Of the other 94.6 percent of the audience, 61.4 percent were watching privately owned television channels, and 33.1 percent were watching paid TV. Since the private TV owners are mostly against the government, it is clear that more than 94 percent of the TV that is seen by Venezuelans is not progovernment. In fact, much of the private media is stridently antigovernment, in ways that go beyond the boundaries of what is permitted in the United States, for example. There are no data that describe the breakdown of audience share of the various TV channels on the basis of political bias. However, it is clear from this data, based on household surveys over a 10-year period, that statements about the Venezuelan government “controlling” or “dominating” the media are not only exaggerated, but simply false.
in the 2013 election, the opposition candidate Capriles routinely received more airtime than Maduro: <https://www.cartercenter.org/resources/pdfs/news/peace_publications/election_reports/venezuela-final-rpt-2013-elections.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/547505802416619521/unknown.png

# economy: "socialism", privatization, re-nationalization
the 1982 crash was caused by privatization: <https://www.theguardian.com/business/1998/nov/22/observerbusiness.theobserver> Pinochet did not destroy Chile's economy all by himself. He had the help of academia's most brilliant minds: a gaggle of Milton Friedman's trainees, the Chicago Boys. Under their spell, the General abolished the minimum wage, outlawed union bargaining, privatised the pension system, abolished all taxes on wealth and business profits, slashed public employment, privatised 212 industries and 66 banks and ran a fiscal surplus. Free of the dead hand of bureaucracy, taxes and unions, the country took a giant leap... into bankruptcy and depression. After nine years of Chicago-style economics, Chile's industry keeled over and died. [....] The Chicago Boys persuaded the junta that removing restrictions on the nation's banks would free them to attract foreign capital to fund industrial expansion. Pinochet sold off the state banks - at a 40 per cent discount against book value. They fell into the hands of two conglomerate empires, controlled by speculators Javier Vial and Manuel Cruzsat. Using these banks, Vial and Cruzat bought up manufacturers, then leveraged these assets with loans from foreign investors panting for their piece of the state giveaway. By 1982, the pyramid finance game was up. The Vial and Cruzat 'Grupos' defaulted. Industry shut down, private pensions became worthless, and the currency swooned. Riots and strikes by a population too desperate to fear bullets forced Pinochet to boot out his beloved Chicago experimentalists.
after the crash, Pinochet moved back towards "socialism" (re-nationalization of the copper firms): <https://www.theguardian.com/business/1998/nov/22/observerbusiness.theobserver> Reluctantly, the General restored the minimum wage and collective bargaining. Having previously decimated the ranks of state employees, he authorised a programme to create 500,000 jobs. Chile was pulled from depression by dull old Keynesian remedies, all Franklin Roosevelt, zero Margaret Thatcher. (The junta even instituted what is today South America's only law restricting the flow of foreign capital.) New Deal tactics rescued Chile from the panic of 1983, but the nation's long-term recovery and growth is the result of (cover the children's ears) a large dose of socialism. To save the nation's pension system, Pinochet nationalised banks and industry on a scale unimagined by Salvador Allende. The General expropriated at will, offering little or no compensation. While most were eventually reprivatised, the state retained ownership of one industry: copper. For nearly a century, copper has meant Chile and Chile has meant copper. Dr Janet Finn, metals expert at the University of Montana, remarks: 'It's absurd to describe a nation as a miracle of free enterprise when the engine of the economy remains in government hands.' (And not just any government: a Pinochet law, still in force, gives the military 10 per cent of state copper revenues.) Copper has provided between 30 and 70 per cent of the nation's export earnings. This is the hard currency that has built today's Chile. The proceeds from the mines seized from Anaconda and Kennecott in 1973 was Allende's posthumous gift to his nation. Agribusiness was the second locomotive of the Allende years. According to Professor Arturo Vasquez of Georgetown University, Washington DC, Allende's land reform, the break-up of feudal estates (which Pinochet could not fully reverse), created a new class of productive tiller-owners who, along with corporate and co-operative operators, now bring in a stream of export earnings to rival copper.

# economy: sabotague
the CIA funded the truckers and taxi strikes that crippled the Chilean economy: <https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/20/archives/cia-is-linked-to-strikes-in-chile-that-beset-allend> The Central Intelligence Agency secretly financed striking labor unions and trade groups in Chile for more than 18 months before President Salvador Allende Gossens was overthrown, intelligence sources revealed today. They said that the majority of more than $8 million authorized for clandestine C.I.A. activities in Chile was used in 1972 and 1973 to provide strike benefits and other means of support for anti‐Allende strikers and workers. [....] Among those heavily subsidized, the sources said, were the organizers of a nationwide truck strike that lasted 26 days in the fall of 1972, seriously disrupting Chile's economy and provoking the first of a series of labor crises for President Allende. Continue reading the main story Direct subsidies, the sources said, also were provided for a strike of middle‐class shopkeepers and a taxi strike among others, that disrupted the capital city of Santiago in the summer of 1973, shortly before Mr. Allende was over thrown by a military coup. At its peak, the 1973 strikes involved more than 250,000 truck drivers, shopkeepers and professionals who banded to gether in a middle‐class move ment that, many analysts have concluded, made a violent overthrow inevitable.
shop-owners and the USA both worked to create an artificial shortage of food: <https://oxfordre.com/latinamericanhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199366439.001.0001/acrefore-9780199366439-e-106>: The march protested shortages of foodstuffs and a distribution system that generated long lines of shoppers waiting to buy basic products at controlled prices. The shortages themselves were a product of conservative obstruction, as store owners took items off the shelves and sold them on the black market; the opposition media created panic-buying by reporting on shortages that did not (yet) exist, and Washington instituted an “invisible blockade” by denying credit to the UP government.
the IMF, acting for US interests, largely blocked loan requests from Chile: <http://michael-hudson.com/2003/10/chiles-failed-economic-laboratory/> After Pinochet was installed, the IMF and World Bank restructured Chilean debt on much more favorable terms than those afforded Allende, and foreign banks returned almost overnight.
the IMF was more than happy to give big loans to Pinochet: <https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/05/business/chile-is-expected-to-get-900-million-imf-loan.html> <https://archive.fo/lFaBw>

# CIA opposition
the CIA funded the 1964 election: <https://oxfordre.com/latinamericanhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199366439.001.0001/acrefore-9780199366439-e-106> "The CIA sweetened the alliance, providing an estimated $4 million of covert assistance to Frei and stood behind the PDC’s scare campaign designed to play to women voters, intimating that if Allende won, they stood to lose their children, their homes, and even the concept of motherhood itself."
the CIA planned to sabotague Allende's presidency: <https://oxfordre.com/latinamericanhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199366439.001.0001/acrefore> A smooth transition was further undermined by the Nixon Administration’s determination to block Allende. As part of a broader scheme, the CIA supplied a group of right-wing plotters with arms and funding to kidnap the constitutionalist Commander-in-Chief of the Army, General René Schneider, an outrage to be blamed on the Left and designed to prod the military into action against Allende.45 The plot failed, Schneider was killed, and on October 24, Congress elected the UP’s candidate. But intransigent opposition to Allende from Washington, the National Party, and an emerging paramilitary right, together with Christian Democratic distrust, suggested how demanding would be his task ahead.
the CIA funded the 1970 election: <https://oxfordre.com/latinamericanhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199366439.001.0001/acrefore-9780199366439-e-106> With polling predicting an Alessandri victory, and the CIA funding a spoiling operation designed to raise fears of Allende, Washington expected voters would again reject the socialist.

Allende refused the revolutionary path, to his party's leadership's chagrin: <https://oxfordre.com/latinamericanhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199366439.001.0001/acrefore> Debate within the PS revealed a sharply divided party. Members of the party’s Central Committee, having declared the party Marxist-Leninist in 1967, opposed Allende’s selection, but the rank-and-file and regional party heads were firm in their support for the only person they thought could unite the left. In January 1970, the UP named him their candidate. It was, the Communist’s Luís Corvalán dryly observed, “a forceps birth.”
Allende's economic policy was aimed at increasing democratic support: <https://oxfordre.com/latinamericanhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199366439.001.0001/acrefore> Allende’s approach tightly entwined economic and political policy. An economy that expanded through Keynesian demand-side measures, advanced national producers at the expense of multinational firms and small businesses over monopolies, turned land over to peasant cultivators, and redistributed income, would also, he predicted, engender support at the polls. With enough time, he could introduce a plebiscite allowing the constitutional changes needed to give him the authority to further expand state control of the economy, create a single legislative chamber, and reform the judiciary.
Allende refused to use military power to implement his goals: <https://oxfordre.com/latinamericanhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199366439.001.0001/acrefore-9780199366439-e-106> When Army General Roberto Viaux revolted against Frei in 1969, the Central Committee of the Socialist Party called on workers “not to defend the bourgeois institutional order, but [instead] to mobilize around their own social and political demands.” Allende vigorously dissented and rushed to the Moneda to show his support for the President.66 And yet, Allende’s conviction that the military must respect the constitutional order was not shared by his conservative opponents. Even before Allende was elected, Jorge Alessandri, in a May 1970 campaign speech, had called on the “patriotic” military to intervene as needed “to save the liberty that we so love” from those who hold “criminal doctrines.”67

engels on material conditions: <https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1890/letters/90_09_21.htm> """According to the materialist conception of history, the ultimately determining element in history is the production and reproduction of real life. Other than this neither Marx nor I have ever asserted. Hence if somebody twists this into saying that the economic element is the only determining one, he transforms that proposition into a meaningless, abstract, senseless phrase.""""""Without making oneself ridiculous it would be a difficult thing to explain in terms of economics the existence of every small state in Germany, past and present, or the origin of the High German consonant permutations, which widened the geographic partition wall formed by the mountains from the Sudetic range to the Taunus to form a regular fissure across all Germany.""""""Marx and I are ourselves partly to blame for the fact that the younger people sometimes lay more stress on the economic side than is due to it. We had to emphasise the main principle vis-à-vis our adversaries, who denied it, and we had not always the time, the place or the opportunity to give their due to the other elements involved in the interaction."""

# biden and the 1994 crime bill
background from Wikipedia: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_Crime_Control_and_Law_Enforcement_Act> """The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, H.R. 3355, Pub.L. 103–322 is an Act of Congress dealing with crime and law enforcement; it became law in 1994. It is the largest crime bill in the history of the United States and consisted of 356 pages that provided for 100,000 new police officers, $9.7 billion in funding for prisons and $6.1 billion in funding for prevention programs, which were designed with significant input from experienced police officers.[1] Sponsored by Representative Jack Brooks of Texas, the bill was originally written by Senator Joe Biden of Delaware and then was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Bill Clinton."""
opinion polling: passage of the crime bill was preceded by a significant increase in the belief that crime was the "most important" issue and followed by a substantial decrease in said belief: <https://cdn.ymaws.com/counciloncj.org/resource/resmgr/crime_bill/overview_and_reflections.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/732991338059923486/unknown.png
opinion polling: most black voters and many black representatives (28 of 41) supported the 1994 crime bill: <https://www.chicagotribune.com/columns/steve-chapman/ct-column-biden-booker-crime-1994-chapman-20190726-lihqcq7qhbffnfu57lyktyjdl4-story.html> """A 1994 Gallup survey found that 58% of African Americans supported the crime bill — compared with 49% of whites. The only black senator, Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois, supported it. Of the 40 members of the Congressional Black Caucus, just 12 voted against it."""
most Americans and most black people supported the conservative elements of the 1994 crime bill, in the context of the 1960-1990 crime wave: <https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/162844> """It is no wonder that many African Americans had started to embrace punitive prescriptions by 1994. In the General Social Survey, black support for the death penalty for individuals convicted of murder increased from 39 percent in 1980 to 53.5 percent in 1992. African Americans certainly supported rehabilitation more than whites and desired gun control. Many were also clear-eyed about racial disparities in the criminal justice system. According to a 1994 Los Angeles Times poll, 43 percent of African Americans believed that stricter laws and prison sentences would increase discrimination against minority groups. Still, concern about racism and liberal tendencies did not curtail black support for punishment. In that same poll, 71 percent of blacks said that juveniles who commit crimes should be treated as adults, and 67 percent supported proposals that would require “any criminal convicted of three violent felonies be imprisoned for life without the possibility of parole.” Other surveys confirm these trends. In a Wall Street Journal/NBC survey, majorities of racial minorities supported adding 100,000 more police officers on the streets, allowing juveniles as young as 14 to be tried as adults when accused of a serious crime, and making more offenses eligible for the death penalty. A 1994 Time/CNN poll showed that, while only 33 percent of African Americans supported stop and frisk, 64.5 percent favored “life imprisonment for anyone convicted of three serious crimes” and 79 percent supported a 10pm curfew for children under the age of 18. Based her analysis of this survey, Katherine Tate, an expert on African American politics at Brown University, concluded that black opinion “favored the conservative elements of Clinton’s crime bill.”"""
Gallup: 1994 saw highest support for "more law enforcement" as approach to lowering crime: <https://news.gallup.com/poll/1603/crime.aspx> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/732993039794176060/unknown.png

Congressman John Conyers, the dean of the Congressional Black Caucus and then-chair of the House Judiciary Committee, led an effort to promote an alternative crime bill, deriding prison expansion as a “simplistic approach to the crime problem.” The Black Caucus bill emphasized support for crime prevention programs, drug treatment, and creating job opportunities.

We also see similar patterns for foreign countries who have retaliated against the U.S., which indicates that the trade war also reduced real income for other countries.

# foreign policy
trump is no pacifist: https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/08/09/donald-trump-is-dropping-bombs-at-unprecedented-levels/ Judging from Trump’s embrace of the use of air power [...] he is the most hawkish president in modern history. Under Trump, the United States has dropped about 20,650 bombs through July 31, or 80 percent the number dropped under Obama for the entirety of 2016. At this rate, Trump will exceed Obama’s last-year total by Labor Day. In Iraq and Syria, data shows that the United States is dropping bombs at unprecedented levels. In July, the coalition to defeat the Islamic State (read: the United States) dropped 4,313 bombs, 77 percent more than it dropped last July. In June, the number was 4,848 — 1,600 more bombs than were dropped in any one month under President Barack Obama since the anti-ISIS campaign started three years ago. In Afghanistan, the number of weapons released has also shot up since Trump took office. April saw more bombs dropped in the country since the height of Obama’s troop surge in 2012. That was also the month that the United States bombed Afghanistan’s Mamand Valley with the largest non-nuclear bomb ever dropped in combat.

# berniebros didn't vote for clinton: false
only 1 in 10 Sanders voters ended up voting for Trump, comparable to switches for other candidates: <https://www.npr.org/2017/08/24/545812242/1-in-10-sanders-primary-voters-ended-up-supporting-trump-survey-finds> Fully 12 percent of people who voted for Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., in the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries voted for President Trump in the general election. [....] Schaffner tells NPR that around 12 percent of Republican primary voters (including 34 percent of Ohio Gov. John Kasich voters and 11 percent of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio voters) ended up voting for Clinton. And according to one 2008 study, around 25 percent of Clinton primary voters in that election ended up voting for Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., in the general. (In addition, the data showed 13 percent of McCain primary voters ended up voting for Obama, and 9 percent of Obama voters ended up voting for McCain — perhaps signaling something that swayed voters between primaries and the general election, or some amount of error in the data, or both.)

# procedure: house vote
CLAIM: the impeachment inquiry is invalid because the House did not vote to open it: <https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PAC-Letter-10.08.2019.pdf> """Your inquiry is constitutionally invalid and a violation of due process. In the history of our Nation, the House of Representatives has never attempted to launch an impeachment inquiry against the President without a majority of the House taking political accountability for that decision by voting to authorize such a dramatic constitutional step."""
reality: the House voted 232-196 for impeachment inquiry: <https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/10/31/takeaways-houses-impeachment-inquiry-vote/> <http://archive.is/wip/o8ytu>
REALITY: House votes aren't necessary for impeachment anyways: <https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/12/us/politics/fact-check-impeachment.html> <http://archive.is/JOwr7#selection-527.0-556.0> """For example, impeachment inquiries into three federal judges in the 1980s began without explicit authorization by the full House, according to the report. While the whole House voted to start impeachment investigations into Mr. Clinton and Mr. Nixon, whether such a vote was taken in Mr. Johnson’s is more ambiguous. In the second attempt to impeach the 17th president, the full House voted on and approved resolutions authorizing the Committee on Reconstruction to begin a general investigation and to obtain the evidence gathered previously by the Judiciary Committee. But those resolutions did not explicitly authorize a second impeachment inquiry. “There’s no requirement in the Constitution that the House do anything specific, in any order, prior to voting to approve articles of impeachment,” said Stephen Vladek, a constitutional law professor at the University of Texas."""

# procedure: judiciary committee
CLAIM: impeachments inquiries must be conducted by the House Judiciary committee: <https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2019/10/06/ratcliffe_doj_inspector_generals_report_on_fisa_abuse_during_2016_election_will_be_released_friday.html> """In the 240-plus years of our history, those rare times where we have had impeachment process, it’s always gone through the House Judiciary Committee, because the House Judiciary Committee is the committee of jurisdiction over the Constitution and over impeachment. It’s not the Intelligence Committee."""
REALITY: impeachment inquiries need not be conducted by the House Judiciary committee -- indeed, several impeachments predate the House Judiciary committee: <https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/12/us/politics/fact-check-impeachment.html> <http://archive.is/JOwr7#selection-443.85-471.1> But while impeachment inquiries have been typically conducted by the House Judiciary Committee since its formation in 1813, there is no rule mandating it and there is precedent for other committees taking the lead. Special committees began impeachment inquiries against federal judges in 1804, 1808 and 1839. And in 1867, after the Judiciary Committee voted to not send articles of impeachment against President Andrew Johnson to the full House, a second attempt to impeach him succeeded after an inquiry by the Committee on Reconstruction.

# procedure: trial rights
CLAIM: the impeachment inquiry was invalid because the President wasn't able to cross-examine witnesses, call witnesses, and otherwise defend himself, as in a trial: <https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PAC-Letter-10.08.2019.pdf> """Yet the Committees have decided to deny the President these elementary rights and protections that form the basis of the American justice system and are protected by the Constitution. No citizen - including the President - should be treated this unfairly.""""""To comply with the Constitution's demands, appropriate procedures would include-at a minimum-the right to see all evidence, to present evidence, to call witnesses, to have counsel present at all hearings, to cross-examine all witnesses, to make objections relating to the examination of witnesses or the admissibility of testimony and evidence, and to respond to evidence and testimony. Likewise, the Committees must provide for the disclosure of all evidence favorable to the President and all evidence bearing on the credibility of witnesses called to testify in the inquiry. The Committees' current procedures provide none of these basic constitutional rights."""
REALITY: the House investigates and charges people (which doesn't require these rights), while the Senate tries them (which does): <https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/12/us/politics/fact-check-impeachment.html> <http://archive.is/JOwr7#selection-587.0-606.0> """This argument — which featured prominently in Mr. Cipollone’s letter and has been echoed by other defenders of Mr. Trump — misrepresents the separation of duties in Congress in regards to the impeachment process: The House investigates and charges, and the Senate holds trial. Allowing the subject of an impeachment inquiry to call witnesses or present counterevidence is not required in either the Constitution or House rules. The House Judiciary Committee did hear testimony from the White House counsel at the request of the Clinton administration in 1998 and allowed Mr. Nixon’s defense lawyers to present rebutting evidence in 1974. But no such accommodation was made in Mr. Johnson’s case, who was impeached by the House before it even drew up articles of impeachment."""
REALITY: the Senate's rules make clear that the President can access all of these rights in their Senate trial: <https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/SMAN-113/pdf/SMAN-113-pg223.pdf> <https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/3_1986SenatesImpeachmentRules.pdf> eg: """XVII. Witnesses shall be examined by one person on be- 186 half of the party producing them, and then cross-examined by one person on the other side."""

# procedure: secret hearings
1/4 of Republicans (those on Intelligence, Oversight or Foreign Affairs) can attend the hearings, about as many as Democrats -- and 1/4 of the Republicans doing the sit-in against the impeachment inquiry hearing could attend the hearings: <http://web.archive.org/web/20191023235818/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/10/23/heres-why-matt-gaetz-sit-in-stunt-was-particularly-weird/> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/658039831045341184/unknown.png

Thus, the true civilian fatality rate since 2004 according to our analysis is approximately 32 percent. Averaging the press reports in 2009 indicates that 502 people were killed, 382 of whom were described as militants, for an average civilian fatality rate of 24 percent.

# drone strikes: anti-terrorism efficacy
drone strikes in Pakistan have a positive correlation with terrorism within a week and a negative correlation with terrorism after the first week: <https://academic.oup.com/cesifo/article/64/4/667/4996288> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/635326283735367690/ify011f1.png """We find that there is little significant impact of drone strikes on Taliban attacks in Afghanistan but that there is a significant impact of drone strikes on Taliban attacks in Pakistan. This impact varies from a positive vengeance effect in the first week following a drone strike to a negative deterrent/incapacitation effect in the second week following a drone strike, when we examine the incidence of terrorist attacks by the Taliban.""""""We find that a terrorist attack in Pakistan is 17.7% less likely to occur 3 days after a successful drone strike. At the same time we find that a terrorist attack is 9.7 and 7.5% more likely to occur five and 6 days after an unsuccessful drone strike, and that a terrorist attack is 7.5 and 8.7% less likely to occur 12 and 13 days after an unsuccessful drone strike. There are 0.283 fewer terrorist attacks in Pakistan 15 days after a successful drone strike, 0.099 more terrorist attacks in Pakistan 6 days after an unsuccessful drone strike, and 0.121 fewer terrorist attacks in Pakistan 12 days after an unsuccessful drone strike (all else constant). These effects are statistically significant. Because all of the statistically significant coefficients on successful drone strikes are negative, it appears that there is an incapacitation effect of the Taliban due to a lost militant leader."""

While not himself a racist, Mr. Goldwater articulated a philosophy which gave aid and comfort to the racist. His candidacy and philosophy would serve as an umbrella under which extremists of all stripes would stand."""
RNC Chairman Michael Steele: <https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/08/how-trump-remixed-the-republican-southern-strategy/495719/> """For the last 40-plus years we had a "Southern strategy" that alienated many minority voters by focusing on the white male vote in the South. Well, guess what happened in 1992, folks, "Bubba" went back home to the Democratic Party and voted for Bill Clinton."""
Nixon political strategist Kevin Phillips: <http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/books/phillips-southern.pdf> """From now on, the Republicans are never going to get more than 10 to 20 percent of the Negro vote and they don't need any more than that... but Republicans would be shortsighted if they weakened enforcement of the Voting Rights Act. The more Negroes who register as Democrats in the South, the sooner the Negrophobe whites will quit the Democrats and become Republicans. That's where the votes are. Without that prodding from the blacks, the whites will backslide into their old comfortable arrangement with the local Democrats."""
Reagan and Bush I strategist Lee Atwater: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Atwater> """You start out in 1954 by saying, "N****r, n****r, n****r." By 1968 you can't say "n****r" — that hurts you. Backfires. So you say stuff like forced busing, states' rights and all that stuff. You're getting so abstract now [that] you're talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you're talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is [that] blacks get hurt worse than whites. And subconsciously maybe that is part of it. I'm not saying that. But I'm saying that if it is getting that abstract, and that coded, that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the other. You follow me — because obviously sitting around saying, "We want to cut this," is much more abstract than even the busing thing, and a hell of a lot more abstract than "n****r, n****r.""""

# nondemocratic: sham 2007 presidential
the 2007 Syrian election was a referendum, not an election -- Assad had no opponents: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Syrian_presidential_election> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/633316037126914078/unknown.png

# nondemocratic: sham 2014 presidential
the 2014 Syrian election results summaries were accurate *to the voter*, suggesting the results were arrived at first, then the number of voters who voted for each candidate: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Syrian_presidential_election> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/633316768634503171/unknown.png Andrew Gelman suggested that the results could be fabricated based on the unlikely accurate numbers.[48] For example, 10,319,723/11,634,412 = 0.886999962, so the 88.7% number for Bashar al-Assad is correct to the nearest single voter. Similarly, the proportion for NIACS comes out at 0.042999938 and for the Independent party at 0.031999985. But whilst Gelman's argument provides evidence that the published counts were fabricated, he admits that it does not preclude the theory that those numbers could have been generated retrospectively (and unprofessionally) from valid percentages. The proportion reported for turnout, 0.734237287, does not exhibit the unusual property found in the vote counts.

# war crimes: confirmed and unconfirmed chemical attacks
* TLDR: Confirmed: 2013 Khan al-Assal (Syrian government), 2013 Ghouta (Syrian government)
Syrian government: 19 March 2013 Khan al-Assal: UN found sufficient evidence for sarin use (numerous eyewitness reports) but could not obtain environmental or blood samples and could not evaluate munitions: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_al-Assal_chemical_attack> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Mission_to_Investigate_Alleged_Uses_of_Chemical_Weapons_in_the_Syrian_Arab_Republic> <https://undocs.org/A/68/663> Due to the deteriorating security situation, the United Nations Mission was not able to conduct an on-site visit to Khan Al Asal and therefore was not in a position to collect primary evidence relating to the number or type of munitions and/or delivery system that was used in the incident. [....] Due to the deteriorating security situation, the United Nations Mission was not able to conduct an on-site visit to Khan Al Asal and therefore was not in a position to collect environmental samples. In addition, six months following the incident, the probative value of such samples would be negligible. The Russian Federation presented the United Nations Mission with its own report relying on environmental samples collected by a Russian investigation team, which found remainders of Sarin. The United Nations Mission studied the report but could not independently verify the chain of custody for the sampling and the transport of the samples. [....] The United Nations Mission applied the standards for epidemiologic determination of cause-and-effect and assessed that an organophosphorous intoxication was the cause of the rapidly onsetting mass intoxication taking place on the morning of the 19 March 2013. Based on its interviews and the assessment of the medical records obtained from five hospitals receiving the alleged victims, the United Nations Mission did not determine any alternative explanations for the symptoms.
Unknown: 13 April 2013 Sheikh Maqsood: UN could not obtain environmental or blood samples: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Syrian_Civil_War_(January%E2%80%93April_2013)#13_April> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Mission_to_Investigate_Alleged_Uses_of_Chemical_Weapons_in_the_Syrian_Arab_Republic> <https://undocs.org/A/68/663> The United Nations Mission sought to conduct fact-finding activities pertaining to this incident from the territory of a bordering country, having determined that such an investigation held the prospect of producing additional information. The United Nations Mission was ultimately unable to obtain any such information.
Unknown: 29 April 2013 Saraqueb: UN could not obtain environmental or blood samples: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saraqib_chemical_attack> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Mission_to_Investigate_Alleged_Uses_of_Chemical_Weapons_in_the_Syrian_Arab_Republic> <https://undocs.org/A/68/663> The United Nations Mission was not able to conduct an on-site visit and therefore was not able to collect any environmental samples. The French Government presented a report containing results of environmental samples testing positive for Sarin. The United Nations Mission studied the report but could not independently verify the chain of custody for the sampling and the transport of the samples.
Syrian government: 21 August 2013 Ghouta: UN found sufficient evidence for sarin use (environmental samples 2x, blood samples, eyewitness reports) from surface-to-surface rockets with sufficient quality that the perpetrator must have had access to the Syrian military's chemical weapons stockpile: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghouta_chemical_attack> <https://undocs.org/A/67/997> [O]n 21 August 2013, chemical weapons have been used in the ongoing conflict between the parties in the Syrian Arab Republic, also against civilians, including children, on a relatively large scale. In particular, the environmental, chemical and medical samples we have collected provide clear and convincing evidence that surface-to-surface rockets containing the nerve agent Sarin were used in Ein Tarma, Moadamiyah and Zamalka in the Ghouta area of Damascus. [....] Close to the rocket impact sites, in the area where patients were affected, the environment was found to be contaminated by Sarin. <https://undocs.org/A/68/663> The final laboratory results on environmental samples from Ghouta (Moadamiyah and Zamalka) are published below (see table 5.1). The results further support the conclusion of the earlier report (A/67/997-S/2013/553), improving the consistency between the results of the two laboratories. <https://www.refworld.org/docid/53182eed4.html> The evidence available concerning the nature, quality and quantity of the agents used on 21 August indicated that the perpetrators likely had access to the chemical weapons stockpile of the Syrian military, as well as the expertise and equipment necessary to manipulate safely large amount of chemical agents. Concerning the incident in Khan Al-Assal on 19 March, the chemical agents used in that attack bore the same unique hallmarks as those used in Al-Ghouta.
Not chemical weapons: 22 August 2013 Bahhariyeh: UN found sufficient evidence against chemical weapon use (blood samples): <https://undocs.org/A/67/997> The United Nations Mission was not able to conduct an on-site visit and was therefore not able to collect any environmental samples. [....] Blood and urine samples were collected from the most severely intoxicated patients. The analysis results tested negative for any of the chemical warfare agents.
Unknown: 24 August 2013 Jobar: <https://undocs.org/A/68/663> UN found sufficient evidence for sarin use (blood samples x2, eyewitness reports) but could not evaluate munitions: While the United Nations Mission visited the site, it found the site to have been corrupted by mine-clearing activities. As such, there was no probative value in collecting samples. The Syrian Government allegedly recovered soil samples from the impact site that tested positive for Sarin. The United Nations Mission could not verify the chain of custody for this sampling and subsequent analysis. [....] The United Nations Mission was given four samples reportedly withdrawn by the Syrian Government on 24 August 2013 upon the victims’ arrival to the hospital, which were all positive for Sarin exposure. The United Nations Mission collected four blood samples on 28 September 2013, one of which tested positive for Sarin exposure. All samples were subjected to DNA testing to confirm the origin of the presented whole blood samples. The analyses confirmed that the four samples provided by the Syrian Government matched those of the four alleged victims interviewed and sampled. The medical records received from Martyr Yusuf Al Azmah Military Hospital provided corroborating evidence of cholinesterase inhibition indicating Sarin exposure in two of the four patients.
Unknown: 25 August 2013 Ashrafiah Sahnaya: UN found sufficient evidence for sarin use (blood samples x2) but could not evaluate munitions: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Mission_to_Investigate_Alleged_Uses_of_Chemical_Weapons_in_the_Syrian_Arab_Republic> <https://undocs.org/A/68/663> The United Nations Mission did not visit the site of the alleged incident and was therefore not in a position to collect primary information concerning the munitions. According to witnesses, a catapult allegedly threw unidentified objects aiming at the military checkpoint. [....] The United Nations Mission did not visit the site of the alleged incident and was therefore not in a position to collect environmental samples. [....] On 29 September 2013, the United Nations Mission was given five samples allegedly drawn by the Syrian Government on 25 August 2013 upon the arrival of the patients at the hospital. The United Nations Mission drew its own blood samples on 26 and 28 September 2013. 107. All samples were subjected to DNA testing to confirm the origin of the presented whole blood samples. The analyses confirmed that the samples provided by the Syrian Government matched those of the alleged victims interviewed and sampled. The five blood samples drawn on 25 August 2013 all tested positive for Sarin exposure, whereas those drawn on 26 and 28 September tested negative.

UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria 2017: claims of ethnic cleansing by Rojava / DFNS are false, but displaced people face significant hunger, thirst, and homelessness: <http://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/14032017> """The Commission notes in its report that mass numbers of people were displaced during SDF offensives to oust ISIS from Manbij city in the summer of 2016 and Tishreen Dam in December 2015 and that some continue to remain unable to return to their homes, “living under dire humanitarian conditions.” However, “the presence of concealed bombs laid by ISIL justifies ordering the temporary displacement of civilians,” the Commission stated, using an alternate acronym for ISIS. While the displacement was justified, the Commission noted that the SDF and YPG failed to provide adequate assistance to the displaced families in the form of basics like shelter, food, and health care."""
from 2014-2017, the most that Amnesty International could allege against Rojava (a state of 6 million in a 4-year war against ISIS, Syria, and Turkey) are: one forced population movement, one unjustified bulldozing of a village, several unjustified arrests of journalists, and incomplete due process in the courts: <https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/middle-east-and-north-africa/syria/report-syria/> <https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde24/6381/2017/en/> <https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde24/6871/2017/en/> <https://www.amnesty.org/en/press-releases/2015/10/syria-us-allys-razing-of-villages-amounts-to-war-crimes/> <https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/09/syria-abuses-mar-pyd-fight-against-terrorism/> <https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde24/2503/2015/en/> <https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2014/11/life-and-death-in-no-man-s-land-between-syria-and-turkey/>

# 9/11 and the axis of evil
George Bush, 29 January 2002, includes Iraq in the axis of evil that will export terror like 9/11: <https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-before-joint-session-the-congress-the-state-the-union-22> **Our second goal is to prevent regimes that sponsor terror from threatening America or our friends and allies with weapons of mass destruction. Some of these regimes have been pretty quiet since September the 11th, but we know their true nature.** North Korea is a regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction, while starving its citizens. Iran aggressively pursues these weapons and exports terror, while an unelected few repress the Iranian people's hope for freedom. **Iraq continues to flaunt its hostility toward America and to support terror. The Iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax and nerve gas and nuclear weapons for over a decade. This is a regime that has already used poison gas to murder thousands of its own citizens, leaving the bodies of mothers huddled over their dead children. This is a regime that agreed to international inspections, then kicked out the inspectors. This is a regime that has something to hide from the civilized world.** States like these and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world. By seeking weapons of mass destruction, these regimes pose a grave and growing danger. They could provide these arms to terrorists, giving them the means to match their hatred. They could attack our allies or attempt to blackmail the United States. In any of these cases, the price of indifference would be catastrophic.
George Bush, 07 October 2002, alleges Iraq could harbor Al-Qaeda in the future: <https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/10/20021007-8.html> We know that Iraq and the al Qaeda terrorist network share a common enemy -- the United States of America. We know that Iraq and al Qaeda have had high-level contacts that go back a decade. Some al Qaeda leaders who fled Afghanistan went to Iraq. These include one very senior al Qaeda leader who received medical treatment in Baghdad this year, and who has been associated with planning for chemical and biological attacks. We've learned that Iraq has trained al Qaeda members in bomb-making and poisons and deadly gases. And we know that after September the 11th, Saddam Hussein's regime gleefully celebrated the terrorist attacks on America. Iraq could decide on any given day to provide a biological or chemical weapon to a terrorist group or individual terrorists. Alliance with terrorists could allow the Iraqi regime to attack America without leaving any fingerprints. Some have argued that confronting the threat from Iraq could detract from the war against terror. To the contrary; confronting the threat posed by Iraq is crucial to winning the war on terror. When I spoke to Congress more than a year ago, I said that those who harbor terrorists are as guilty as the terrorists themselves. Saddam Hussein is harboring terrorists and the instruments of terror, the instruments of mass death and destruction. And he cannot be trusted. The risk is simply too great that he will use them, or provide them to a terror network.

# iran deal: military sites
inspection of military sites is possible but somewhat delayed: <https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2017/09/13/549217764/should-nuclear-inspectors-be-demanding-access-to-irans-military-sites> Under something called the Additional Protocol, which Iran accepted as part of the JCPOA, inspectors can request access to undeclared sites, including military sites. But the agreement spells out a series of steps to gain that access that could take as long as 24 days to complete.
more importantly, we can literally just detect the radiation: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txQwHFeeDtM>

# iran deal: didn't pass the senate
the jcpoa is a "political commitment", which is nonbinding and does not require a 2/3 approval in the senate; it is not a "treaty" or "executive agreement". in 2015, Congress passed a law demanding review on the Iran deal. <http://opiniojuris.org/2015/03/11/dealing-with-iran-a-primer-on-the-presidents-options-for-a-nuclear-agreement/> <http://web.archive.org/web/20150816014154/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/07/09/the-role-of-congress-or-lack-thereof-in-the-iran-deal-explained/> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_Nuclear_Agreement_Review_Act_of_2015>
JCPOA legislative history, from Wikipedia: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action#Review_period_in_the_United_States_Congress> On 19 July 2015, the State Department officially transmitted to Congress the JCPOA, its annexes, and related materials.[162] These documents included the Unclassified Verification Assessment Report on the JCPOA and the Intelligence Community's Classified Annex to the Verification Assessment Report.[162] The sixty-day review period began the next day, 20 July,[162][163][159] and ended 17 September.[164] Senator Ted Cruz introduced a resolution seeking a delay in the review period, arguing that the sixty-day congressional review under the Act should not begin until the Senate obtains a copy of all bilateral Iran-IAEA documents. This resolution did not pass.[165][166] Ultimately, a resolution of disapproval was brought to the Senate floor, but failed. A resolution of approval was brought to the House floor, but it, too, failed. As a result, the agreement went into effect following congressional review period.[167]
Senate vote: <https://iranprimer.usip.org/blog/2015/sep/11/congress-votes-deal> Senate: 42 for, 58 against; as long as it wasn't vetoed (67 for), the bill would become law
House vote: <https://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/253370-house-rejects-iran-deal> House: 162 for, 269 against; as long as it wasn't vetoed (291 for), the bill would become law

# iran deal: israeli documents
the Israeli documents did not show that Iran was actively breaking the nuclear deal; they merely confirmed existence of a secret nuclear program that ended in 2004: <https://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2018/281346.htm> <https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/netanyahu-s-info-iran-nukes-known-u-s-intelligence-years-n870456> <https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/papers-stolen-in-a-daring-israeli-raid-on-tehran-archive-reveal-the-extent-of-irans-past-weapons-research/2018/07/15/0f7911c8-877c-11e8-8553-a3ce89036c78_story.html> [Secretary of State Michael Pompeo:] The existence of the AMAD program that ended roughly December of 2003, January of 2004, it is accurate to say that the knowledge of that has been known for – the fact of that had been known for quite some time. But there are thousands of new documents and new information. We’re still going through it. There’s still a lot of work to do to figure out precisely the scope and scale of it. But it is the case – it – there is new information about that program.

# iran deal: heavy water violations
iran technically but minimally violated the JCPOA twice in 2016: it overproduced heavy water, but then shut down said heavy water production plant: <https://www.armscontrol.org/blog/2017-07-11/p51-iran-nuclear-deal-alert-july-2017> <https://www.armscontrol.org/blog/ArmsControlNow/2016-09-30/The-P5-plus-1-and-Iran-Nuclear-Deal-Alert-December-22> <https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-idUSKBN18T244> "The report noted that Iran had slightly exceeded the heavy-water stockpile limit of 130 metric tons set out in the deal. The report said that Iran had 130.1 metric tons Nov. 8. Iran says it has since shipped out 11 metric tons for storage in Oman."

The images of Yablonska Street show at least 11 "dark objects of similar size to a human body" appearing between 9 and 11 March. Their location precisely matches positions where the bodies were filmed by a local council member after Ukrainian forces reclaimed the city. A second video on the same street shows three bodies near bicycles and abandoned cars, which according to satellite imagery appeared between 20 and 21 March. The Times concluded that the analysis rebuts Russian claims about the killing of civilians happening after withdrawal of the Russian army.

# bucha massacre: german intelligence
Der Spiegel, 2022 April 7: the German foreign intelligence service BND intercepted radio traffic from north of Kiev; BND claims the audio incriminates Russian soldiers, who spoke about killing civilians as though it were commonplace; BND claims the audio indicates that the Wagner Group was present: <https://archive.ph/iRL2l> <https://archive.ph/6cGKv> """The intercepted comments now appear to refute Russia’s denials. DER SPIEGEL has learned that the BND briefed parliamentarians on Wednesday about its findings. Some of the intercepted traffic apparently matches the locations of bodies found along the main road through town. In one of them, a soldier apparently told another that they had just shot a person on a bicycle. That corresponds to the photo of the dead body lying next to a bicycle that has been shared around the world. In another intercepted conversation, a man apparently said: First you interrogate soldiers, then you shoot them. The BND material also apparently provides evidence that members of the Russian mercenary unit called the Wagner Group played a leading role in the atrocities. The group is known to have perpetrated similar atrocities in Syria. [....] The radio traffic intercepted by the BND makes it seem as though the atrocities perpetrated on civilians in Bucha were neither random acts nor the product of individual soldiers who got out of hand. Rather, say sources familiar with the audio, the material suggests that the troops spoke of the atrocities as though they were simply discussing their everyday lives. That, say sources familiar with the audio, indicates that the murder of civilians has become a standard element of Russian military activity, potentially even part of a broader strategy.

HRW 2022 March 30: Olena alleges hearing of extrajudicial killings, lootings, and random shootings at residences: <https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/03/30/devastation-and-loss-bucha-ukraine> <https://archive.ph/s1qaa> """By March 4, Russian forces were everywhere in Bucha. They drove tanks and armored vehicles through people’s fences and parked them in residential backyards. There were military vehicles at every house, near every apartment building. “We saw them [military vehicles] driving down the street [Sklozavodska], shooting randomly at windows,” Olena said. “They were just shooting.” Russian soldiers went from house to house, breaking doors and windows, searching and questioning people. Olena saw them taking people’s clothes and shoes, changing, and dumping their own clothes on the street. They heard reports of extrajudicial killings and civilians shot while trying to get water. [....] The soldiers walked Olena back to Yablunska Street and told her to stand facing away from her house. One of them shot a gun at her feet, marking a line of bullet holes on the road. “See this line? Walk along it, do not sway,” he told her. “If you veer left or right, you are dead.”"""

He said that it happened on March 5, at around 1 p.m. “It was quiet, so we got out of the shelter, [went to the house] and were on the ground floor, in a room. And then [shelling] hit the house, two direct hits, one after another. We all fell to the floor. Two or three minutes later we heard glass breaking outside, then loud steps. Someone was yelling: “Check the second floor!” Vitya moved, he got up, there was automatic gunfire and he fell, screaming in pain. He yelled: “Please don’t shoot! I am wounded, there are civilians here, children, don’t shoot.” “The [soldiers] started banging on the door. We opened and they walked in. There were 4 or 5 of them, I don’t even remember now. Their clothes were very dirty, some of them had St. George [orange and black striped] ribbons on their helmets. They told us to get outside, one by one. We went into the yard. We said, there is a wounded man there, please help him. They refused. They said they had no bandages or medicines. We stood there for 30 or 40 minutes while they searched the house. Then they came outside, told us to go in and stay there, and left. We went inside. We tried to help Vitya. He was still alive, lying where we left him. “We cut his sweater open and saw that there was a surface wound on this chest, no entry bullet wound, and I thought for a moment that it was not so bad. But when we turned him over, we saw three bullet holes around his left shoulder blade. His sleeve was soaked through, and the blood pooled on the floor under him. We tried to stop the bleeding with the bedsheet. He was struggling to breathe.” Viktor died 20 minutes later. Dmytro and his family put him on a mattress and dragged him to the boiler room, which was the coldest room in the house. They spent two more nights sheltering in Viktor and Olena’s house before fleeing Bucha. Dmytro’s voice was calm but it shook a little when he said he felt responsible for what happened. “If I hadn’t asked them for help, Vitya might have still been alive.”"""

She said she heard shooting at about 7 a.m. and saw three Russian armored vehicles and four Kamaz [Russian brand] trucks driving down her street. She was sheltering in the cellar with her two dogs when she heard glass breaking, and then her front door being broken down. Voices outside said [in Russian]: “Come outside right now or we will throw a grenade.” She yelled that she was alone in the cellar and came out with her hands up. “There were three men outside, two [Russian] soldiers and a commander,” she said. “They took my phone and checked it, then told me to get my [identification] documents and come with them.” As she walked down the street with the soldiers, she saw that they were also rounding up her neighbors and ordering them to walk. She said: They took us to where the office of AgroButpostach [a rental storage company] used to be. Right next to the building, there is a parking lot and a small square. They gathered people at that square, mostly women but there were also several men among us, over 50 [years old]. There were around 30 military there and the commander had [paratrooper] insignia [on his fatigues]. He spoke with an accent from western or central western Russia…. I was born in Russia myself, so I pick up on such things. The soldiers were all thin and looked the worse for wear. She said that the soldiers brought about 40 people to the square, gathered everyone’s phones, checked documents, and asked who was in territorial defense, or local self-defense units: Two women asked to go to the bathroom. One of them was pregnant. I asked to go with them. A soldier showed us the way to the toilet, which was around the building, I think it was now their headquarters. The building was long. Along the wall on the other side, we saw a large pool of blood. She said they waited in the square for hours in the very cold weather: At one point they brought in one young man, then four more. The soldiers ordered them [to] take off their boots and jackets. They made them kneel on the side of the road. Russian soldiers pulled their T-shirts, from behind and over their heads. They shot one in the back of the head. He fell. Women screamed. The other four men were just kneeling there. The commander said to the rest of the people at the square: “Don’t worry. You are all normal – and this is dirt. We are here to cleanse you from the dirt.” She said that after several more hours the soldiers took the people back to their homes. The other four men remained kneeling when she left. She said that when she was able to leave the town on March 9, the young man’s body was still lying where he had been shot."""

# neo-nazism in the azov battalion
the Azov Battalion's publishing outfit Plomin is openly promoting neo-Nazi writings, such as Freda's "Disintegration of the System", which writes that "We have nothing to see with the mercantile Europe, with the Europe of plutocratic colonialism: nothing to share. We only have accounts to settle with the Jewish or Judaized Europe": <https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2020/01/22/ukraines-far-right-is-boosting-a-pro-putin-fascist/> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/935774510890766376/unknown.png
the Russian far-right generally opposes Putin for moderation on issues like immigration; some supported Ukraine in the Donbas War: <https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2019/09/04/the-hardcore-russian-neo-nazi-group-that-calls-ukraine-home/> """Many Russian far-right nationalists have, perhaps to the surprise of many, been anti-Kremlin and opposed Putin’s rule due to their perception of his soft stance on issues like immigration, best seen in the annual “Russian March”. While a large portion of the Russian far-right was instrumental in fomenting and fighting in the ongoing war in eastern Ukraine, some factions of the Russian far-right actually supported the protests on Maidan Nezalezhnosti in Kyiv that mushroomed into the February 2014 revolution and have found room to operate within Ukraine. This included two of Wotanjugend’s leaders, Ivan Mikheev and Alexey Levkin. As Russian and Russian-led forces — including a sizable presence of Russian far-right nationalists, namely through the influence of Konstantin Malofeev and Eduard Limonov — began war in the Donbas in April 2014, some Wotanjugend members were among Russian far-right nationalists who came to Ukraine to fight with far-right pro-Ukrainian forces, including the Azov Battalion. Mikheev and Levkin, along with other Russian neo-Nazis like Roman Zheleznov, came to Ukraine in late 2014; Levkin and others remain in Ukraine five years later."""

# ukrainian government promotions of far-right: frequent
Bellingcat 2019: in 2019, Ukrainian Prime Minister Honcharuk promoted the "Veterans Strong" concert and spoke at it, organized by S14 member Andriy Medvedko, headlined by neo-Nazi band Sokyra Peruna: <https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2019/10/21/how-to-mainstream-neo-nazis-a-lesson-from-ukraines-new-government/> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/935790553835143218/unknown.png
Bellingcat 2019: in 2019, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy invited Azov Battalion leaders and spoke of them as "veterans" in discussing peace talks in the region: <https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2019/10/21/how-to-mainstream-neo-nazis-a-lesson-from-ukraines-new-government/> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/935791041473314826/unknown.png https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/935784583222419526/unknown.png """Another example of this trend was on display in early October at a meeting with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, when members of the far-right (including C14 leader Yevhen Karas) were invited to offer their perspective on the war in eastern Ukraine. Azov was also present, being the largest far-right group in Ukraine that also has a regiment in Ukraine’s National Guard. “Yesterday I met with veterans,” Zelenskyy said in early October, “National Corps [the Azov movement’s political party], Azov, everyone else.” A photo from the meeting shows multiple far-right figures in attendance, including C14’s Yevhen Karas and Dmytro Shatrovskyi, head of the Azov-linked “Veterans Brotherhood.” [....] However, why does Zelenskyy meet with multiple representatives of far-right groups — and, moreover, speak of them simply as “veterans,” discounting the vast majority of Ukraine’s veterans who have no involvement in extremist organizations? Why are there multiple members of far-right groups, including people who are openly neo-Nazi, on Ukraine’s Ministry of Veterans Affairs public oversight council? Despite the fact that these far-right organizations have negligible popular support and virtually nonexistent electoral power, they are over-represented among veterans’ rights groups, including in meetings directly with Ukraine’s President. As the veterans’ concert shows, these issues are symptoms of a much larger problem relating to the far-right’s exploitation of veterans’ issues as they continue to have success mainstreaming themselves in Ukrainian politics and society."""

* PIS is Poland's conservative party:
PIS is seizing control of the state media: <https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/07/poland-president-signs-bill-putting-state-media-under-government-control>: Poland’s president has signed into law a bill handing the conservative government control of state media, despite concern elsewhere in the EU and condemnation from rights watchdogs. [....] Under the new law, senior figures in public radio and television will be appointed – and sacked – by the treasury minister, and will no longer be hired by the National Broadcasting Council. Under the legislation current managers and supervisory board members of Poland’s public broadcasters will be fired with immediate effect.
PIS is seizing control of the independent judiciary: <https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-07-20/poland-steps-away-democracy-and-eu-latest-judiciary-reforms>: Lawmakers in the lower house of parliament, which is controlled by the ruling far-right Law and Justice Party (PiS), have passed a bill that would force 83 of the nation’s top judges to resign and will give the governing party control over who replaces them. In Poland, the Supreme Court is not only the final court of appeal for all criminal and civil cases, but also the body that rules on the validity of elections — which is exactly what concerns the EU and political opponents.
PIS is trying to ban *all* abortions, even for safety: <https://jacobinmag.com/2018/03/poland-black-protests-womens-strike-abortion-pis>: It wasn’t until 2016, when the right-wing Law and Justice Party (PiS), led by Jaroslaw Kaczynski, introduced a bill that would have made abortion completely illegal that the women’s movement was able to break out of this isolation. Abortion is legal in Poland only in three cases: when pregnancy is the result of rape, when the fetus shows risks of severe damage or illness, and when the life of the woman is endangered. Unfortunately, even under these conditions women often do not obtain permission to terminate pregnancies, which leads them either to illegal abortions, in Poland or abroad, or to face serious risks to give birth anyways. Official statistics count only around 100 legal abortions per year in Poland; but, according to feminist organizations, some 140,000 illegal ones are additionally carried out. The PiS bill would have made abortion illegal even in these exceptional cases. Additionally, it would have criminalized not only women who sought abortions, but their doctors and anyone else who assisted them, allowing them to be sentenced to up to two years of jail time.
PIS is trying to criminalize discussion of Poland's part in the Holocaust: <https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/06/poland-antisemitism-nationalism-holocaust>: Under the guise of defending the good name of “The Polish Nation” the bill opens the way to criminalising anyone who seeks to reveal dark chapters of Polish history, such as antisemitic pogroms before, during and after the war. But this is a veneer. What is truly at stake is not Poland’s reputation, but Polish nationalist rightwing tradition. The ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) makes no secret of the fact that it is part of this tradition. The language and ideas of PiS leaders, as well as their policies towards refugees, minorities and political opposition, draw directly from the rhetoric and strategy of Polish nationalism in the first half of the 20th century. [It's already been used for this purpose: <https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/05/polish-group-files-suit-against-argentina-newspaper-over-holocaust-story> ]
PIS supported thousands of far-right marchers with racist slogans under falangist banners: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/12/white-europe-60000-nationalists-march-on-polands-independence-day: Tens of thousands of nationalist demonstrators marched through Warsaw at the weekend to mark Poland’s independence day, throwing red-smoke bombs and carrying banners with slogans such as “white Europe of brotherly nations”. Police estimated 60,000 people took part in Saturday’s event, in what experts say was one of the biggest gathering of far-right activists in Europe in recent years. Demonstrators with faces covered chanted “Pure Poland, white Poland!” and “Refugees get out!” [....] TVP, which reflects the conservative government’s line, called it a “great march of patriots”, and in its broadcasts described the event as one that drew mostly ordinary Poles expressing their love of Poland, not extremists.

# fascists were anti-socialists: nazi rhetoric
#####o
# But weren't the Nazis the National **Socialist** German **Workers'** Party?
Yes. However, as he stated in this 1938 speech, Hitler was **explicitly** not a socialist in the "economically left and socially left" sense ( <https://books.google.com/books?id=PxZoAAAAMAAJ&q=Our+adopted+term+%27Socialist%27+has+nothing+to+do+with+Marxian+Socialism.+Marxism+is+anti-property;+true+Socialism+is+not> ): """'Socialist' I define from the word 'social; meaning in the main ‘social equity’. A Socialist is one who serves the common good without giving up his individuality or personality or the product of his personal efficiency. **Our adopted term 'Socialist' has nothing to do with Marxian Socialism. Marxism is anti-property; true socialism is not.** Marxism places no value on the individual, or individual effort, of efficiency; true Socialism values the individual and encourages him in individual efficiency, at the same time holding that his interests as an individual must be in consonance with those of the community. All great inventions, discoveries, achievements were first the product of an individual brain. It is charged against me that I am against property, that I am an atheist. Both charges are false."""

# But weren't the Nazis the National **Socialist** German **Workers'** Party?
Yes. However, as he stated in this 1935 speech, Hitler saw many differences between his ideology and the USSR's: <https://books.google.com/books?id=r_-htwAACAAJ&dq=hitler+may+21+1935+speech> """National Socialism is a doctrine that has reference exclusively to the German people. Bolshevism lays stress on international mission.""""""National Socialism fights for the reconciliation and consequent adjustment of the differences in life and the union of all for common benefits. Bolshevism teaches the overcoming of an alleged class rule by the dictatorship of the power of a different class.""""""As National Socialists, our hearts are full with admiration and respect for the great achievements of the past, not only in our own people but also far beyond. We are happy to belong to an European cultural community that has so tremendously embossed today's world with a stamp of its mind. Bolshevism rejects this cultural achievement of mankind, claiming that has found the beginning of the real cultural and human history in the year of birth of Marxism.""""""We, National Socialists, do not want to be of the same opinion as our church organizations in this or that organizational question. But we never want a lack of belief in religion or any faith, and do not wish that our churches become club-houses or cinemas. Bolshevism teaches the godlessness and acts accordingly.""""""We National Socialists see in private property a higher level of human economic development that according to the differences in performance controls the management of what has been accomplished enabling and guaranteeing the advantage of a higher standard of living for everyone. Bolshevism destroys not only private property but also private initiative and the readiness to shoulder responsibility."""

# But didn't the Nazis and the socialists both use red?
The Nazi flag colors (black, white, red) come from the imperial German flag colors (black, white, red). For example, the nationalist imperial German propaganda song "Stolz weht die Flagge schwarz-weiß-rot" (The Flag Proudly Waves Black-White-Red) <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolz_weht_die_Flagge_schwarz-wei%C3%9F-rot> <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIs3S6ckTmw> was explicitly mirrored in Nazi propaganda song "Deutschland du Land der Treue" in the lines "Hakenkreuzfahnen schwarz, weiss, und rot" (Swastika flags black, white, and red) <http://soldatenlieder.blogspot.com/2012/03/deutschland-du-land-der-treue-heil.html> <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cvvFm2Vi6M>. Moreover, the use of red in Nazi propaganda was an intentional anti-left tactic, as Hitler stated in Mein Kampf, 1922, Book 2 Vol 2 p. 270: <http://www.hitler.org/writings/Mein_Kampf/mkv2ch07.html> "We chose red for our posters after particular and careful deliberation, our intention being to irritate the Left, so as to arouse their attention and tempt them to come to our meetings -- if only in order to break them up -- so that in this way we got a chance of talking to the people."

# national socialist people's welfare
because the Nazis consolidated local and state programs, they did increase the federal German budget for social spending: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Socialist_People%27s_Welfare> In three budgetary years, the funds required by Germany's social welfare programs had more than doubled from 640.4 million Reichmarks in 1938 to 1.395 billion Reichmarks by 1941.[12]

# fascist italy: capitalist winners, labor losers
italy reduced wages (and utterly failed to replicate FDR's success): <http://www.gustavopiga.it/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/PaperGiordanoPigaTrovato_November2011.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/570334413787889677/unknown.png President Roosevelt, as well as raising prices to favor industrialists, also increased workers’ bargaining power and, therefore, their wages. The Fascist government, on the contrary, being more attentive to industrialists’ concerns, on the one hand fought the drop in consumer prices, but on the other, abolished most of the workers’ bargaining power and intervened systematically in cutting wages.

# But didn't the Nazis seize control of industry?
Yes and no. The Nazis arose during the Great Depression. During this time, **all** Western nations (including the Nazis) used some nationalization and regulation to stablize their economies and later to prepare for war. However, the Nazis **privatized** previously-nationalized industries. (In fact, the term "privatization" was coined to describe Nazi economic policies <http://www.ub.edu/graap/JEP.pdf>.) As Germa Bel writes: <http://www.ub.edu/gim/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/EHR_bel.pdf>: "The Great Depression spurred State ownership in Western capitalist countries. Germany was no exception; the last governments of the Weimar Republic took over firms in diverse sectors. **Later, the Nazi regime transferred public ownership and public services to the private sector. In doing so, they went against the mainstream trends in the Western capitalist countries, none of which systematically reprivatized firms during the 1930s.** Privatization in Nazi Germany was also unique in transferring to private hands the delivery of public services previously provided by government. The firms and the services transferred to private ownership belonged to diverse sectors. **Privatization was part of an intentional policy with multiple objectives and was not ideologically driven.** As in many recent privatizations, particularly within the European Union, strong financial restrictions were a central motivation. In addition, privatization was used as a political tool to enhance support for the government and for the Nazi Party."

# But didn't the Fascists seize control of industry?
No. In fact, Fascist Italy engaged in the first large-scale privatization in modern Western history: As Germa Bel writes: <http://www.ub.edu/graap/bel_Italy_fascist.pdf> "Italy’s first Fascist government applied a large-scale privatization policy between 1922 and 1925. The government privatized the state monopoly of match sale, eliminated the State monopoly on life insurances, sold most of the State-owned telephone networks and services to private firms, reprivatized the largest metal machinery producer, and awarded concessions to private firms to build and operate motorways. These interventions represent one of the earliest and most decisive privatization episodes in the Western world. While ideological considerations may have had a certain influence, privatization was used mainly as a political tool to build confidence among industrialists and to increase support for the government and the Partito Nazionale Fascista. Privatization also contributed to balancing the budget, which was the core objective of Fascist economic policy in its first phase."

# But didn't the Nazis control industry indirectly and destroy private property?
Yes and no. The Nazis arose during the Great Depression. During this time, **all** Western nations (including the Nazis) used some nationalization and regulation to stablize their economies and later to prepare for war. However, the Nazis believed that private businesses were more efficient than state planning. Thus, business was heavily involved in the Nazis' planning processes <https://libcom.org/files/Daniel%20Guerin-Fascism%20and%20Big%20Business-Pathfinder%20Press%20(2000).pdf> and private property and the profit motive both remained solidly intact, as Buchheim and Scherner write: ( <http://economics.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/Workshops-Seminars/Economic-History/buchheim-041020.pdf>): "Private property in the industry of the Third Reich is often considered a mere nominal provision without much substance. However, that is not correct, because **firms, despite the rationing and licensing activities of the state, still had ample scope to devise their own production and investment profiles.** Even regarding war-related projects, freedom of contract was generally respected; instead of using power, the state offered firms a number of contract options to choose from. **There were several motives behind this attitude of the regime, among them the conviction that private property provided important incentives for increasing efficiency.**"

# But didn't the Nazis set official wages?
Yes and no. Prior to the Nazis, the Weimar Republic (under socialist influence) created collective wage agreements across industries in hopes of preventing "cut-throat" competition for labor. In contrast, the Nazi official wage rates were far lower than Weimar wage rates, could be overruled (allowing lower pay) for individual companies by the DAF's "labor trustees", and disallowed the possibility of collective bargaining by the workers. <https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/003232928501400101>

# But didn't the Nazis create the "Labor Front"?
Yes. The Nazis established the German Labour Front (Deutsche Arbeitsfront, DAF). To establish the DAF, the Nazis destroyed non-DAF trade unions as "leftist" and seized their funds <https://www.teachers.org.uk/files/trade-unionists-leaflet.pdf>. In name, the DAF was intended to mediate conflicts between businessowners and workers. In practice, the Nazis used the DAF to decrease the worker power and to trap workers in their current place of employment, as William Shirer notes: <https://books.google.com/books?id=fpFbuCKOLKwC&lpg=PP1&pg=PT449#v=onepage&f=false> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/561310446171324425/unknown.png https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/561313705271230473/unknown.png

# But didn't the Nazis create "Strength through Joy", Kraft durch Freude?
Yes. KdF was a large vacation program established to sell the working class on Nazism and to boost German tourism <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_Through_Joy>; in practice, it was heavily involved in regimenting the leisure time of workers towards Nazi goals rather than allowing them freedom: <https://books.google.com/books?id=fpFbuCKOLKwC&lpg=PP1&pg=PT453#v=onepage&q&f=false> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/561314617423298580/unknown.png

# rich were more likely to vote for Hitler
Simon 2021: summary of book: wealthier districts were more likely to vote for Hitler, likely because they bought into the fear campaign against the Communists (and somewhat the Socialists): <https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/trump-hitler-nazi-fascism/> <https://archive.ph/l0zca> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/976592303969931304/unknown.png """In Berlin, “the highest levels of support for the National Socialists came from the upper- and upper-middle-class districts.” Accounting for the Jewish vote and the Catholics who voted for the Center Party, Hitler’s Nazis commanded some 60 percent of the vote in those districts—nearly twice the national average. On the other hand, the lower-middle-class and working-class districts gave Hitler’s party a substantial minority of their votes, somewhere between one-quarter and three-eighths. The trend in Berlin was repeated in Frankfurt, Cologne, Munich, Hanover, Stuttgart, Nuremberg, and Mannheim, with slight variations. Again and again, Hamilton shows below-average support for Hitler in working-class districts, and higher support in upper-middle-class and wealthy ones. There were pockets of rabid support for the Nazis in rural areas. But what we see repeated in chapter after chapter of Who Voted for Hitler? is the disproportionate support for Hitler from the well-heeled districts, motivated by their sense that Hitler would be their weapon against Communism; and because the Nazis had also successfully nurtured a covert anti-Semitism among the upper classes. Working class-neighborhoods were split more evenly, drawn to the Communists or Social Democrats, not strongly anti-Semitic, though susceptible certainly to the Nazi’s organizing exertions."""
Simon 2021: haunting comparison: <https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/trump-hitler-nazi-fascism/> <https://archive.ph/l0zca> """A most impactful provision of the Versailles treaty, it turns out, was to drastically reduce the size of the German military, pushing out hundreds of thousands of young men, “providing these men with one very substantial additional grievance and then injecting them directly into civilian life,” as Hamilton writes. A pithy and breathtaking comparison might be drawn here with the decommissioning of the rebel army at the end of the only other protracted war of the prior century, which was America’s Civil War, and the rise of the Ku Klux Klan and other vigilante groups that followed it."""
Challenging the traditional belief that Hitler's supporters were largely from the lower middle class, Richard F. Hamilton analyzes Nazi electoral successes by turning to previously untapped sources--urban voting records. This examination of data from a series of elections in fourteen of the largest German cities shows that in most of them the vote for the Nazis varied directly with the class level of the district, with the wealthiest districts giving it the strongest support.

Staff from the Centre of Archaeology undertook non-invasive fieldwork at both Treblinka I and II in 2010, 2012 and 2013 in order to identify the locations of the camp boundaries, mass graves and gas chambers; aims that were successfully achieved [2], [3], [12]. This work involved walkover survey, topographic survey (with DGPS and a Total Station) and geophysical survey. Excavations were also undertaken in 2013 which confirmed the location of one of the gas chamber buildings and identified a number of personal belongings. During this fieldwork season, and a subsequent season in 2017, the methodology described below was employed in order to further characterize the terrain of, and evidence contained within, both camps.
yes, there have been archaeological studies of Treblinka -- using radar: <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10761-017-0432-3> The excavation of Trench 4 confirmed that the 22 × 15 m anomaly in the GPR results did in fact represent the foundations of the first gas chambers built by the Nazis at Treblinka (known as the old gas chambers), which existed at a depth of 0.85 m below the ground. [....] Dentures, and gold and silver teeth were also found along with a considerable amount of fragmented human remains, some of which exhibited evidence of burning and some that did not. All of these different types of material traces were commingled, confirming the nature of destruction afforded to the gas chambers in autumn 1943 and the heavily disturbed nature of the ground exhibited in the GPR results.

# the holocaust is not separate from Western civilization
askHistorians post: <https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4vgeki/marxist_historical_analyses_of_the_holocaust/d5zgkqz/> The historical understanding of Nazism and the Holocaust as »accidents of history« or part of a totalitarian trend averse to liberal, capitalist development are part of hegemonic discourse of portraying the current capitalist order as the best possible of all worlds and thus making them out to be the natural and unimporvable state of things often, consciously or unconsciously, aimed at squashing any kind of resistance against Capitalist hegemony. Understanding Nazism and the Holocaust as linked to factors inherent in capitalism – racism, colonialism, imperialism – is act of challenging the hegemony on the basis of its historical narrative. By historically rigorously pointing to these explicit links, a direct or indirect critique of the status quo, which in its most extreme forms can bring forward the catastrophe of Nazism, the hegemonic narrative is challenged and a blow of resistance is delivered.
askHistorians post: <https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4tln3x/steve_king_the_contributions_of_western_civ/d5ko61i/> Within historiography of the subject, the interesting thing to see is that the first two I mentioned are pretty much dead as of now and nobody would use them anymore. Generational and paradigm shifts as well as careful examination of the evidence have left us with only the latter two that understand Nazism as a product of modernity rather than it aberration or it being outside of modernity. Totalitarianism also doesn't hold up to historical examination, which leaves us with a variation of the last explanation, which is also in my opinion the most convincing.

# leuchter report
testimony from lab manager James Roth: <http://www.errolmorris.com/film/mrd_transcript.html> I don't think the Leuchter results have any meaning. There's nothing in any of our data that says those surfaces were exposed or not. Even after I got off the stand, I didn't know where the samples came from. I didn't know which samples were which. And it was only at lunch that I found out, really, what the case involved. Hindsight being 20/20, the test was not the correct one to have been used for the analysis. He presented us with rock samples anywhere from the size of your thumb up to half the size of your fist. **We broke them up with a hammer so that we could get a sub-sample; we placed it in a flask, add concentrated sulfuric acid.** It undergoes a reaction that produces a red-colored solution. It is the intensity of this red color that we can relate with cyanide concentration. You have to look at what happens to cyanide when it reacts with a wall. Where does it go? How far does it go? **Cyanide is a surface reaction. It's probably not going to penetrate more than 10 microns. Human hair is 100 microns in diameter. Crush this sample up, I have just diluted that sample 10,000; 100,000 times. If you're going to go look for it, you're going to look on the surface only.** There's no reason to go deep, because it's not going to be there. Which was the exposed surface? I didn't even have any idea. **That's like analyzing paint on a wall by analyzing the timber that's behind it.** If they go in with blinders on, they will see what they want to see. What was he really trying to do? What was he trying to prove?

# holocaust denial: red cross death toll statistics
these reports were not published directly by the ICRC, but were actually published by the Bad Arolsen special registry office [Sonderstandesamt Bad Arolsen (SBA)]; the SBA mostly received its information from the International Tracing Service (ITS), which was run by the ICRC from 1955 to 2012 and is dedicated to providing death certificates requested by families of those killed in concentration and death camps with certified death cases [beurkundeten Sterbefälle], meaning cases where the person's death was actually recorded (most death camp killings were unrecorded, many camp records were destroyed, and not all families survived or requested certificates): <http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.com/2017/05/rebutting-twitter-denial-most-popular.html#redcrossstats> <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonderstandesamt_Bad_Arolsen> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arolsen_Archives_-_International_Center_on_Nazi_Persecution>
the ICRC confirmed this in 1975 in a letter written by Francoise Perret: "The figures cited by the author of the [Holocaust denial ]booklet are based upon statistics falsely attributed to us, evidently for the purpose of giving them credibility, despite the fact that we never publish information of this kind"; "Unfortunately, our delegates were not able to enter the camps until the very end of the war.": https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/863270565191876618/xJCzhbc_d.png the "300,000" figure is referring to an erroneous article written by a Swiss holocaust denier
the ICRC confirmed this again in 1978 with an official publication decrying "false propaganda": <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0031322X.1978.9969431> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1080/0031322X.1978.9969431> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/863271875710550026/0031322x.png """Consequently the ICRC considers it must make clear the fact that it has never published — or even compiled — statistics of this kind which are being falsely attributed to it. The work of the ICRC is to help war victims, not to count them. In any case, how could its delegates have obtained data for such statistics? They were able to enter only a few concentration camps, and then only in the final days of the war. [....] The same propaganda scheme has recently been making use of other figures, namely the number of deaths recorded by the International Tracing Service on the basis of documents found when the camps were closed. Obviously this number bears no relation — though the authors of the propaganda pretend otherwise — to the total deaths in concentration camps; firstly because a considerable quantity of documentay material was destroyed before the departure of the Nazi administration, and secondly because many deaths were never recorded, such as those which occurred in the extermination camps where records were generally not kept."""
a document published by the SBA in 1979 (shown here with additions in English by a holocaust denier) explicitly states that "I am giving you the number of *certified deaths* in the individual concentration camps: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/863283397640060958/1478990797438.png includes 271504 deaths in 13 camps; """Sachstehend teile ich ihnen die Zahlen der beurkundeten Sterbefälle in den einzelnen Konzentrationslagern mit [sp?]."""

the US delegation of the Red Cross wrote in 1943 that "it is unfortunately extremely difficult for the ICRCC to help the Jewish population in Germany and the occupied countries" and that it could not access "concentration camps" and could not "check on the distribution of relief supplies" because "the German authorities do not consider the civilians who are arrested in occupied countries [...] as civilian internees, thereby excluding them from the application [...] of the Geneva Convention": <http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.com/2017/05/rebutting-twitter-denial-most-popular.html#redcrosscamps> <https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112039810327&view=1up&seq=283> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/863259289179521034/uiug.30112039810327-seq_283.jpg https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/863259280768237660/uiug.30112039810327-seq_284.jpg
the ICRC "visit" by Maurice Rossel in 1944 was to the Auschwitz I concentration camp (about 1 kilometer way from the Auschwitz II Birkenau death camp) he was merely allowed to talk to the officers and was not even allowed within the camp:  <http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.com/2015/09/kollerstroms-deception-on-visit-of.html> <https://www.icrc.org/fr/doc/assets/files/2013/auschwitz-rapport-cicr-1944.pdf> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/863262667677237258/cicr.pdf> """Entretien avec le Commandant : Comme à Oranienburg et à Ravensbrück, les officiers sont ici à la fois aimables et réticents.

But if you would like to send help to the infirmary, or medications, you can do that." [Lanzmann: And what did you see of the camp?] Nothing. Of the camp. I saw barracks. I saw those from where I was. [...] Wooden barracks."""
in the same 1944 report, Rossel interviewed a British POW in a camp in Cieszyn [Teschen, about 50km from Auschwitz II Birkenau] who asked if they had heard about the "shower room" where people were "gassed in series": <http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.com/2015/09/kollerstroms-deception-on-visit-of.html> <https://www.icrc.org/fr/doc/assets/files/2013/auschwitz-rapport-cicr-1944.pdf> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/863262667677237258/cicr.pdf> """Spontanément, l’homme de confiance principal britannique de Teschen nous a demandé si nous étions au courant au sujet de la « salle de douches ».

In 1949, however, the World Almanac gives a revised 1939 population of 16,643,120 giving a difference of between 1938 and 1947 of 5,376,520. Where the extra population between 1938 and 1939 came from is not cited, though one might speculate that it was based upon the Nazi estimates made in 1942 for the Wannsee Conference. Despite the apparent exactness of the numbers listed, the World Almanac warns that all numbers listed are estimates.""""""Deniers consider one of their stronger arguments to be the population of Jews before and after the Holocaust. They claim that the 1940 World Almanac gives the world Jewish population as 15,319,359, while the 1949 World Almanac gives the world Jewish population as 15,713,638. In their view this makes it impossible that 6 million Jews died, even given an extremely high birth rate. They therefore claim that either the figures are wrong, or the Holocaust, meaning the deliberate extermination of millions of Jews, cannot have happened.""""""In addition, rather than using more accurate census figures and other records, Holocaust deniers rely on a popular compendium whose methodology of assessment is unknown, and whose estimates have varied significantly. For example, the 1982 World Almanac gives the world Jewish population as 14,318,000, while the 1990 World Almanac gives the world Jewish population as 18,169,000, and the 1996 World Almanac gives the world Jewish population as 13,451,000. Either 3.7 million Jews appeared unnoticed between 1982 and 1990, and then 4.5 million Jews disappeared equally unnoticed between 1990 and 1996, or the World Almanac is not a particularly reliable source for accurate estimates of worldwide Jewish population.""""""This subjectivity, commonly stemming from biases or selectivity of available sources, usually means that Holocaust deniers often ignore the documents produced by the Nazis themselves, who used figures of between 9 and 11 million for the Jewish population of Europe, as evidenced in the notes of the Wannsee Conference. In fact, the Nazis methodically recorded the ongoing reduction of the Jewish population, as in the Korherr Report, which gave the status of the Final Solution through December, 1942: The total number of Jews in the world in 1937 is generally estimated at around 17 million, thereof more than 10 million in Europe... From 1937 to the beginning of 1943 the number of Jews, partially due to the excess mortality of the Jews in Central and Western Europe, partially due to the evacuations especially in the more strongly populated Eastern Territories which are here counted as off-going, should have diminished by an estimated 4 million. It must not be overlooked in this respect that of the deaths of Soviet Russian Jews in the occupied Eastern territories only a part was recorded, whereas deaths in the rest of European Russia and at the front are not included at all.... On the whole European Jewry should since 1933, i.e. in the first decade of National Socialist German power, have lost almost half of its population."""

# diesel engines
Sobibor: one gasoline, one diesel (unused) <https://www.hdot.org/debunking-denial/ds6-engines-used/> SS men Franz Hödl and Erich Fuchs were in charge of installing, maintaining, and operating the gas chamber engine at the Sobibor death camp. Fuchs specifically stated that the engine used at Sobibor was a gasoline engine: “We unloaded the motor. It was a heavy Russian petrol [gasoline] engine (presumably from a tank or tractor engine) of at least 200 HP (V-engine, 8 cylinder, water cooled).”[2] Likewise, Hödl also confirmed that there was a gasoline engine at Sobibor: “In the engine room there were indeed two engines. There was a petrol engine, probably from a Russian tank, and a diesel engine. The latter [the diesel engine] was never used, however.”[3]
Belzec: one gasoline: <https://www.hdot.org/debunking-denial/ds6-engines-used/> We have no testimony from the SS men who used the engine at Belzec. Kurt Gerstein, the SS officer who visited the camp in August 1942, described the engine as a diesel engine. However, he does not say how he knew what type of engine it was, so his testimony is less than conclusive. However, another eyewitness did see and interact with the engine at Belzec. Rudolf Reder was one of just two Jewish survivors from the 450,000 or more Jews murdered at Belzec. In 1944, Reder made a statement to the Central Commission for Investigation of German Crimes in Poland regarding the engines used at Belzec. He described the engine as a “motor pedzony benzyna [gasoline-powered motor].” Reder also said that he carried 4 to 5 cans of petrol (gas) (kanistry benzyny) every day to the motor room of the gas chambers. Reder used the Polish word for gasoline (benzyny/benzyna) not diesel, which is ‘olej napedowy.’[4] Reder’s testimony indicates that the engine at Belzec was also probably a gasoline engine.
Treblinka: one gasoline: <https://www.hdot.org/debunking-denial/ds6-engines-used/> There is one direct eyewitness who actually used the engine at the Treblinka death camp: Nikolay Shalayev. He was one of the so-called Treblinka “motorists.” He testified: “It was an ordinary, four-cylinder engine which used gasoline and, according to the story of the German machine operator, was of Russian make.”[5] As one of the operators of the engine, his evidence indicates that the engine used at Treblinka might have been a gasoline engine as well.

as PhD historian Jonathon House notes, the Nazis were extremely unprepared for a war with the Soviet Union: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zinPbUZUHDE
as amateur historian TIK notes, the USSR did not beat the Nazis with manpower alone: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7BE8CsM9ds
despite having a smaller economy and facing millions of casualties, the USSR outproduced and outfought the Nazis: <https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/mharrison/public/totalwar2005.pdf> Yet table 1 showed that the Soviet Union was not superior to Germany in overall resources. Although Soviet GDP exceeded Germany’s in 1940, German wartime mobilization and the deep invasion of Soviet territory shifted the balance strongly in Germany’s favour. In the most critical years of the war overall Soviet resources were only 70 per cent of Germany’s, and the increment arising from Allied aid compensated only to a small extent. It is true that Germany was engaged on two fronts. Taking this into account, the Soviet Union still maintained a bigger army in the field than Germany and outproduced German industry systematically in weapons other than warships

the Nazis had plans to invade the USSR: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Barbarossa#German_invasion_plans>

the Communists did not have plans to invade Germany: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Barbarossa#Soviet_preparations> Historians have debated whether Stalin was planning an invasion of German territory in the summer of 1941. The debate began in the late-1980s when Viktor Suvorov published a journal article and later the book Icebreaker in which he claimed that Stalin had seen the outbreak of war in Western Europe as an opportunity to spread communist revolutions throughout the continent, and that the Soviet military was being deployed for an imminent attack at the time of the German invasion.[153] This view had also been advanced by former German generals following the war.[154] Suvorov's thesis was fully or partially accepted by a limited number of historians, including Valeri Danilov, Joachim Hoffmann, Mikhail Meltyukhov, and Vladimir Nevezhin, and attracted public attention in Germany, Israel, and Russia.[155][156] It has been strongly rejected by most historians,[157][158] and Icebreaker is generally considered to be an "anti-Soviet tract" in Western countries.[159] David Glantz and Gabriel Gorodetsky wrote books to rebut Suvorov's arguments.[160] The majority of historians believe that Stalin was seeking to avoid war in 1941, as he believed that his military was not ready to fight the German forces.[161]

Nazi saboteur units (Abwehr agents) opened fire on a retreating Polish army and were summarily executed.

The Nazi propaganda machine instructed the press that they "must show news on the barbarism of Poles in Bromberg". After German forces took the city, they executed 1800-3800 Poles as "revenge". <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody_Sunday_(1939)> On 04 October 1939, Adolf Hitler granted amnesty for all crimes committed by German military in Poland between 01 September and 04 October. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_1939#October_4,_1939_(Wednesday)>

# schadewaldt report
The German Foreign Office publication (!) by Hans Schadewaldt is commonly cited; however, it was written after war had begun (!) and it cites no evidence for the alleged 58,000 deaths of Germans in Poland after the German invasion <https://archive.org/details/PolishAtrocitiesAgainstTheGermanMinorityInPoland>: More than 58,000 were lost by the German minority in Poland during the days of their liberation from the Polish yoke, as far as can be ascertained at present. The Polish nation must for all time be held responsible for this appalling massacre consequent upon that Polish reign of terror.

# auschwitz holocaust denial: "too many bodies"
the central office of Auschwitz-Birkenau asserts they could cremate, per day, 340 persons in crematorium 1, 1440 persons in crematorium 2, 1440 persons in crematorium 3, 768 persons in crematorium 4, 768 persons in crematorium 5, which totals to 4765 persons per day, 1,737,129 persons per year, and 4,690,248 persons over Auschwitz-Birkenau's 2.7 years of operation: <https://www.hdot.org/debunking-denial/ab3-german-documents-ovens/> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/642017872838918145/Leisung_der_Krematorien_in_24_Stunden_lt.png According to the Zentralbauleitung letter, given the normal pace of cremation (half an hour for two corpses in one retort), each crematorium could incinerate 768 corpses in 24 hours. However, Sonderkommando prisoners testified that up to 1,500 corpses were burned in 24 hours (three to five within 20 to 30 minutes).
the Vrba-Wetzler report (compiled by escapee Slovak Jews) estimates that the crematoria of Auschwitz-Birkenau could handle 6,000 persons per day, 2,190,000 persons per year, and 5,913,000 persons over Auschwitz-Birkenau's 2.7 years of operation: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vrba%E2%80%93Wetzler_report> <https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/the-vrba-wetzler-report-auschwitz-protocols> At present there are four crematoria in operation at BIRKENAU, two large ones, I and II, and two smaller ones, III and IV. Those of type I and II consist of 3 parts, i.e.,: (A) the furnace room; (B) the large halls; and (C) the gas chamber. A huge chimney rises from the furnace room around which are grouped nine furnaces, each having four openings. Each opening can take three normal corpses at once and after an hour and a half the bodies are completely burned. This corresponds to a daily capacity of about 2,000 bodies... Crematoria III and IV work on nearly the same principle, but their capacity is only half as large. Thus the total capacity of the four cremating and gassing plants at BIRKENAU amounts to about 6,000 daily.
the instructions written by the cremation company: <https://www.hdot.org/debunking-denial/ab4-civilian-ovens-comparison/> "As soon as the remains of the bodies have fallen from the chamotte grid to the ash collection channel below, they should be pulled forward towards the ash removal door, using the scraper. Here they can be left for a further twenty minutes to be fully consumed . . . In the meantime, further bodies can be introduced one after the other into the chambers." - J.C. Pressac, "Technique & Operation..." page 136

For instance, in early 1933, such experiments were carried out in a nearly abandoned four-story building in Berlin. A diagram shows that 95 minutes after the ignition of the soot on the first floor one meter above ground level the combustion temperature of the soot in the smokestack reached 1060°C. This is not really surprising, for soot consists of carbon having an ignition temperature of 700°C."""

The list of transports shows that no trains left Hungary from June 17 to June 24, but were resumed on June 25. The transports took three or four days to get to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Many Hungarian Jews were literally en route to their deaths. In addition, there was no evidence of Hungarian Jews being registered into the camp as slave laborers from June 20 to June 27, 1944, which again proves the suspension of activity."""

"""Lublin, however, was a regular concentration camp; from October 1942 three gas chambers were used to murder prisoners after selections of diose deemed unable to work. The number culled dunng selections in Majdanek from October onwards is known- their sum is much lower than the figures given in Hofle's radio telegram.25 As the document indicates, the murder of Jews transported to Lublin without being registered at the concentration camp became an integral part of Einsatz Rewhardt from an unspecified date onward Further research, one hopes, will hopefully permit more precise information."""

Writte 2001: deportations listed in the Hofle Telegram line up well with survivor reports: <https://academic.oup.com/hgs/article/15/3/468/660291> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/hgs/15.3.468> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/859720445161635840/writte2001.pdf> """A transport from the collection camp Kielbasin is documented, starting on December 14, 1942 and arriving on December 15 at Treblinka, allegedly carrying 7,000 Jews to their death. If their arrival at Treblinka actually took place a day or two later (entirely possible as the date is an estimate), the deportation would fit into the "fortnightly report" of the document. On December 17, 1942, a train left Treblinka via Bialystok to Grodno, presumably to return fully laden again. According to survivor testimony, the last train from Kielbasin left for Treblinka on December 20.21 Whereas Treblinka murdered 10,335 victims in the second half of December 1942, for Sobibor only 515 are recorded These Sobibor Jews must be identical with those ascertained by Scheffler, who listed one deportahon to Sobibor from Staw on December 22, 1942. Details on this deportation emerge from die reports of survivors. It has to be stated diat the number 515 accords well with the sources."""

Most of the approximately 6,000 Jews from Liepāja were murdered in the second half of 1941 - most on 16 and 17 December on a beach north of the city. The killings were carried out by Einsatzgruppe A as well as Latvian auxiliary police. Along the coast a wide grave had been dug. The Jews were lined up in groups of ten on the edge of the tomb; the executioners - two for each victim - were located on the opposite side of the grave. After the killing, the corpses that had not fallen into the grave were kicked down, and the next group was led forward. The course of the killings is documented during a trial at the Landgericht Hannover in 1971 against several of the participants."""

Action T4 was ended in August of 1941 due to civilian and church skepticism and disapproval. However, during the short few years that the program was in effect, an estimated (although probably significantly higher) 80,000 individuals were murdered. Among those murdered were those with schizophrenia, epilepsy, senile diseases, paralysis, encephalitis, Huntington’s disease, feeblemindedness, and those patients were not of German descent and those who were criminally insane (Friedlander, 1997, p. 110).

# comparisons to stalin
Timothy Snyder 2011, liberal historian of Eastern European atrocities (he wrote a whole triology, "Bloodlands", on the subject): <https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2011/03/10/hitler-vs-stalin-who-killed-more/> Today, after two decades of access to Eastern European archives, and thanks to the work of German, Russian, Israeli, and other scholars, we can resolve the question of numbers. The total number of noncombatants killed by the Germans—about 11 million—is roughly what we had thought. The total number of civilians killed by the Soviets, however, is considerably less than we had believed. We know now that the Germans killed more people than the Soviets did.
Steven Wheatcroft 1996, liberal historian of Soviet history: <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09668139608412415> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1080/09668139608412415> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/854781720234557441/wheatcroft1996.pdf> """The nature of Soviet repression and mass killing was clearly far more complex than normally assumed. Mass purposive killings in terms of executions were probably in the order of one million and probably as large as the total number of recorded deaths in the Gulag. In this narrowest category of purposefully caused deaths, the situation is exactly the opposite to that generally accepted. Hitler caused the murder of at least 5 million innocent people largely, it would appear, because he did not like Jews and communists. Stalin by contrast can be charged with causing the purposive death of something in the order of a million people. Furthermore the purposive deaths caused by Hitler fit more closely into the category of 'murder', while those caused by Stalin fit more closely the category of 'execution'. Stalin undoubtedly caused many innocent people to be executed, but it seems likely that he thought many of them guilty of crimes against the state and felt that the execution of others would act as a deterent to the guilty. He signed the papers and insisted on documentation. Hitler, by contrast, wanted to be rid of the Jews and communists simply because they were Jews and communists. He was not concerned about making any pretence at legality. He was careful not to sign anything on this matter and was equally insistent on no documentation. It is only when we get into the broader categories of causing death by criminal neglect and ruthlessness that Stalin probably74 exceeds Hitler, but here we have to remember that the USSR was much larger than Germany and that death rates in the best of times had always been significantly higher in Russia than in Germany."""

In 1870, the Kingdom of Italy conquered Rome. For 59 years afterward, popes refused to leave the Vatican to avoid being seen as beholden to a state. They were called Prisoners in the Vatican. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner_in_the_Vatican>
Guess who let the prisoners out? In 1929, the Pope signed a treaty with Mussolini establish the modern Vatican City. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateran_Treaty>

Each saw himself as heading a “totalitarian” organization, a term they both embraced. It could have only one head and demanded total loyalty. The pope was eager to use the Fascists’ power to resurrect a Catholic state, although he was not so foolish as to think he could ever “Christianize” Mussolini. The Duce was eager to use the power of the Church to solidify his own rule, but in his view the Catholic clergy were to be the handmaidens of the Fascist government, tools to ensure popular support for the regime."""

A 1929 Guardian article describes the Vatican as sharing with fascims support for anti-liberalism, authoritarainism, and anti-socialism: <https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/feb/14/archive-fascism-and-vatican> """One thing seems to be sure – Mussolini has achieved a great diplomatic success, perhaps the greatest of his career. On this there is general agreement. His gain is absolute. Whether the Vatican's gain is so absolute, seems a little uncertain. There is evidently much Italian nationalist sentiment in the Vatican itself. In other words, the Vatican has considerable Fascist sympathies. Pope Pius XI is credited with much admiration for Mussolini. That the Italian clergy as a whole are pro-Fascist is easy to understand, seeing that Fascism is a nationalist, authoritarian, anti-liberal, and anti-Socialist force."""

Democratic governments, he noted, ‘lead people slowly but surely to socialism and communism!’ Instead, what was needed was a strong, nationalistic government interested in protecting ‘order and religious authority’. Perhaps – Bordeaux noted – some of these viewpoints could be encouraged by the competition announcement and play a mandated role in the selection process.50 Having expressed his ‘immense pleasure’ with Bordeaux’s recommendations, Pius XI agreed on the need to restore ‘authority, order, and hierarchy’, according to ‘the principles of the Catholic Church’. Because communists and liberal ‘individualists’ (qua partisans of democracy) did not understand this, prize-winning novels should certainly celebrate authority and the Catholic religion.51 [....] The Pope accordingly suggested that it would be best for the book prize to reward anti-democratic, authoritarian, and religious political thinking, but be wary of lending support to extreme forms of nationalism that might be damaging to the Church and dilute its claims to standing at the helm of a transnational anti-communist movement."""
in 1938, Pope Pius XII wrote that support for state totalitarianism was absurd, but not for the reason you'd think. he wrote that, "if there is a totalitarian regime – in fact and by right – it is the regime of the church, because man belongs totally to the church": <https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/06/pope-mussolini-secret-history-rise-fascism-david-kertzer-review> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pope_and_Mussolini> <https://books.google.com/books?id=Xc3QAgAAQBAJ> <https://u1lib.org/book/2329935/d08ef6> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/713803664518808037/kertzer2014-compressed.pdf> """In 1938, Pope Pius XI addressed a group of visitors to the Vatican.

However, few scholars have noted the extent to which the Pope conceived of the three texts as integrally interrelated, and none have commented on the fact that the Secretariat on Atheism contributed decisively to their drafting. In April of 1936, the Superior General of the Jesuits responded to the news that Vatican theologians were in the midst of writing a theological critique of Nazism by informing the Pope that it was more urgent to draft an encyclical condemning ‘atheistic communism’, given the Soviet’s ‘ever-more intense propaganda’, and the need for ‘Catholics and others to unite in a more energetic and better-organized resistance’. ‘Your Holiness will pardon my boldness’, Ledo´chowski affirmed, suggesting that Secretariat personnel would be ideally suited to composing said text.64 Pius XI immediately accepted the proposal and put the head of the Secretariat on Atheism to work.65"""

# irish potato famine (occurred in a free market)
the irish potato famine occurred during a period of lassiez-faire UK domestic and trade policy: <https://whistlinginthewind.org/2012/08/25/laissez-faire-and-the-irish-great-famine/>
ireland was a net exporter during the famine: <http://www.jrbooksonline.com/PDF_Books/irish.pdf> One of the most remarkable facts about the famine period is that there was an average monthly export of food from Ireland worth 100,000 Pound Sterling. Almost throughout the five-year famine, Ireland remained a net exporter of food. (31.) Dr. Christine Kinealy, a fellow at the University of Liverpool and the author of two scholarly texts on the Irish Famine: This Great Calamity and A Death-Dealing Famine, says that 9,992 calves were exported from Ireland to England during "Black'47", an increase of thirty-three percent from the previous year. In the twelve months following the second failure of the potato crop, 4,000 horses and ponies were exported. The export of livestock to Britain (with the exception of pigs) increased during the "famine". The export of bacon and ham increased. In total, over three million live animals were exported from Ireland between 1846-50, more than the number of people who emigrated during the famine years.
ireland had previously banned exports during the 82-83 famine: <http://www.jrbooksonline.com/PDF_Books/irish.pdf> When Ireland experienced an earlier famine in 1782-83, ports were closed in order to keep home grown food for domestic consumption. Food prices were immediately reduced within Ireland. The merchants lobbied against such efforts, but their protests were over-ridden. Everyone recognized that the interests of the merchants and the distressed people were irreconcilable. In the Great Famine, that recognition was disregarded.
the "English blockade" and "three Turkish ships" are both memes: <https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5jcffu/was_englands_role_in_worsening_the_potato_famine/> <https://mikedashhistory.com/2014/12/29/queen-victorias-5-the-strange-tale-of-turkish-aid-to-ireland-during-the-great-famine/> According to the researches of Brendan Matthews, one of these ships was probably Prussian: she was named the Meta, and her home port was Stettin, on the Baltic Sea. The other two, however, came from the Balkans, which were then still under Ottoman control. They were the Porcupine and the Ann – two rather English names for ships – and they apparently had English masters, for their names were Cleveland and Cloid (Floyd?) Nonetheless, they had sailed from Ottoman Selânik (today Thessaloniki, in modern Greece). All three merchantmen carried cargoes of wheat and “Indian corn” – cheap maize, one of Ireland’s principal imports during the famine years. This is a remarkable find – more so given the rarity of foreign commerce in small Irish ports in those days – but it is only fair to point out that the newspapers contain a strong indication that the cargoes of the Porcupine and the Ann were trade goods, not charity; they were consigned to local merchants based in Louth and Meath, who it might be expected would sell them rather than give them away. Speculation in imported corn, moreover, was scarcely unheard-of two years into the Great Famine; the Ottomans grew it, and the owners of the Porcupine and the Ann presumably knew that they did.

# railroads didn't protect against famine
many Indian famines were not merely regional, meaning that railroads alone could not stop them: <https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/financing-indias-imperial-railways-18751914/indian-railways-and-famines-18751914-magic-wheels-and-empty-stomachs/394F01F6B0F498022F5E9AAA3DB35869> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/701849862752436344/sweeney2014.pdf> """Much of the justification for this emphasis on railways relied on the assumption that Indian famines involved regional shortages rather than a lack of food across the subcontinent as a whole. This was a controversial assumption by the late 1890s, when the worst famine conditions in documented history appeared to be afflicting India, despite the decades of investment in famine protective railways. Even a former consultant to the GOI’s [Government of India] state railways, Horace Bell, was prepared to challenge this assumption. Bell highlighted the 1898 famine commission observation that the food production of British India was in deficit of eighteen to nineteen million tons over the years 1896-1897, and suggested that “an even greater deficiency” must have existed in the more widespread famine of 1898-l900. Government-funded food imports could solve food shortages. Railways and the price mechanism would not be sufficient. In fact, the rise in grain prices during these famines failed to encourage grain traders to target the Indian market since export prices to Britain were still higher. Grain wages were required as part of famine relief due to the poverty of the unemployed Indian peasants. Only Burma, within British India, could offer substantial additional foodstuffs (grain and rice), but the shipping and rail costs from that region made the likely grain/rice price “prohibitive”."""

In 1919, an Indian legislature, consisting of a Council of State and a Legislative Assembly, took over the legislative functions of the Viceroy's Council. The viceroy nonetheless retained significant power over legislation. He could authorise the expenditure of money without the Legislature's consent for "ecclesiastical, political [and] defense" purposes, and for any purpose during "emergencies." He was permitted to veto, or even stop debate on, any bill. If he recommended the passage of a bill, but only one chamber cooperated, he could declare the bill passed over the objections of the other chamber. The Legislature had no authority over foreign affairs and defence. The president of the Council of State was appointed by the viceroy; the Legislative Assembly elected its president, but the election required the viceroy's approval.

# heather on prior immigration
tribal immigration was previously dealt with by Rome by breaking them up and selling them off as slaves: <https://academic.oup.com/ehr/article/CX/435/4/495571> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/ehr/CX.435.4> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/709456552330789044/heather1995.pdf> """Immigration, even large-scale immigration, was not at all a new phe- nomenon; the Empire had a long history of resettling immigrants within its borders.2 Up to the 370s, however, this was done on Roman terms, or else resisted. In the 350s, for instance, the Emperor Julian only pre- tended to be willing to treat with some Salian Franks who had taken possession of Roman territory, to put them off their guard. He then followed up with the army and dealt with them as he pleased.3 The traditional policy towards immigrants, indeed, was thorough military and political subjugation followed by widely dispersed settlement in small groups, an approach obviously designed to minimize any security risk.4"""
Rome attempted to enact the same policies during the Hunnic era: <https://academic.oup.com/ehr/article/CX/435/4/495571> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/ehr/CX.435.4> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/709456552330789044/heather1995.pdf> """Such policies were not abandoned in the Hunnic era for want of trying. In 376, only one of the two Gothic groups which crossed the Danube unsubdued - the Tervingi - did so with Roman permission, and then only because Roman forces were tied up on the Persian front. And even those Goths allowed to cross were then subject to general harass- ment and an attempt (again following standard Roman practice) to assassinate or kidnap their leaders at a banquet given by the local Roman commander. The Empire made a full peace with both groups only in October 382 after six years of warfare, during which several Gothic subgroups had been wiped out, and, until the heavy defeat at Hadria- nople in 378, where the Emperor Valens and two-thirds of his army fell on a single afternoon, imperial policy had been directed precisely to reversing the temporary asylum granted some Goths out of necessity in 376. Even after 382, the Empire was probably still looking to undermine the Gothic autonomy which it ostensibly tolerated.5 Nor did this one enforced modification lead to a more general change in policy. As wehave seen, Odotheus received short shrift in 386, and the Roman state responded aggressively to the crisis of 405-8. Radagaisus was killed and his followers dispersed; so many were sold as slaves that the bottom fell out of the market (Orosius 7. 37. I3 ff.). No concessions were made to Uldin, and many of the Sciri who followed him were again turned into slaves or individual tenant-farmers parcelled out to Roman landowners. Likewise, when an effective response to the Rhine crossing did eventu- ally emerge, one of the two Vandal groups which, together with the Alans, crossed the Pyrenees ceased to exist as an independent unit. In subsequent years, many Suevi similarly fell by the wayside."""

# ward-perkins: external invasion (summarizations by askhistorians, unformatted)
Ward-Perkins: <https://u1lib.org/book/637663/12360a> Rome fell to violent barbarian invasions. Additionally, he takes a materialist approach, focusing his analysis heavily on archaeological evidence, which he believes demonstrates that a substantive decline accompanied the collapse of the Roman state – the primary engine of the classical economy. Like heather, his analysis of the fall is largely monocausal, focusing on the Germanic invaders destruction of the Roman tax base. 'the disappearance of comfort': the decline in high-quality mass-produced goods being widely available well down the social scale; the disappearance of the impressive but fragile long-range trade networks characteristic of the empire; the greatly reduced scale and more primitive style of what little public building (for example, churches) was attempted; the general replacement of strong and elegant brick or stone housing and terra cotta roof tile by cruder thatch and wood houses; even the pitifully withered robustness of the average cow (see the striking illustration on p. 145). These losses are vivid concrete evidence of the fall of Rome.
Ward-Perkins: <https://u1lib.org/book/637663/12360a> Rather, there were simply too many military threats in too many places, and too many military and economic limitations, for the Romans to be able to afford a strong enough response to these threats, and not enough troops to save the west. 
Ward-Perkins: <https://u1lib.org/book/637663/12360a> When these conditions collapsed, standards of living declined. Tableware, luxury goods, good pottery, good tools, sturdy tiled roofs, good buildings of all sorts: all disappeared. Large churches and basilicas, everyday coinage and commercial exchange, the wide distribution of goods and foodstuffs, ease of travel and communication: all disappeared. The fall of Rome brought a sharp decline in literacy, as well as in the unity of language (Latin, as opposed to numerous Germanic dialects), in widely accessible education, in the use of written records and documents, and in the production of literature and history-writing and the whole mentality this reflects.
Ward-Perkins: <https://u1lib.org/book/637663/12360a> Above all, there was in the post-Roman Latin West a rise of localism: a society composed of small, fairly isolated rural settlements that were more or less selfsufficient economically and self-sufficient in local defence, relying mainly on local potentes (armed elites and warlords with small private armies or bodyguards). The decline of sophisticated, centralized government, and the rise of localism, meant that basic needs and the demands for survival left most people no free time for education, art, literature, and architecture.
Ward-Perkins: <https://u1lib.org/book/637663/12360a> And as Ward-Perkins shows, with the collapse of centralized and unified Roman political authority and of a complex economy and system of trade, the civilization of the west also collapsed.

# goldsworthy: internal weaknesses
summarization by askhistorians, unformatted: <https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3s8avg/fall_of_the_roman_empire/> This led to a devastating vicious cycle: The empire is under threat. A local commander takes action, but then makes a bid for power and starts a civil war. This reduces the strength of the frontier. This encourages Rome's enemies to mount raids and invasions. This forces local commanders to take action, which then causes a new round of civil wars. This process led to the crisis of the third century, wherein 30 emperors ruled in a period of 50 years. The Danubian soldier-emperors of the late 3rd/early 4th centuries restored order, though, and under emperors such as Diocletian and Constantine a new series of reforms took place. Armies too were centralised: the emperors now started to keep large field armies with them at all times, so they could respond to threats, but more importantly so they would be safeguarded from usurpation by their commanders. This system worked, but it came at a price. This reduced the risk of civil war, but increased the tax burden on the empire and weakened border defences Goldsworthy describes a process in which imperial authority always tried to draw support from "safe" social classes. Augustus relied on the Ordo Equester, the second-tier Roman nobility often translated as "knights", because senators would be too likely to see themselves as his equals and usurp authority. However, by Diocletian's time, it had become common practice for men of relatively low birth to become emperors. The class was no longer safe. The habit of using German military strongmen started. As outsiders, often reviled by Roman elites, such men could not realistically hope to achieve imperial titles for themselves. However, that did not last long. In the 5th century, these military leaders started using a succession of weak emperors in the east and west as puppets. It was the German military leaders who had the real power, and used it against eachother in new series of civil wars, even though ostensibly the same Roman emperor might sit on the throne for long periods of time. So again, short-term stability soon devolved into new internal weakness. It was these weaknesses which then enabled the Germanic invaders of the 4th and 5th centuries to replace the central Roman authority. As Goldsworthy puts it: """[The Roman Empire] may well have been "murdered" by barbarian invaders, but these struck at a body made vulnerable by long decay."""

Roman literacy was probably less than 20%: <https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3huswa/how_literate_was_the_average_roman_citizen_did/> """In conclusion: Probably less than 20% were literate at a level that we would today recognize as 'literate', however, a much larger percentage of the population was able to produce and read or write texts at lower levels of competency (like Brian from Judaea). This would differ a lot from area to area, and close inspections on the available material haven't been done for many places, where they were done they have sometimes lead to higher estimates than expected. It's an interesting question, and a subject of constant inquiry. Text was very important and ubiquitous in the Roman world, and some levels of basic understanding must have been there for most people."""

# other: lead consumptions
lead consumption *increased* with economic status: <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128153390000147> <http://sci-hub.se/10.1016/B978-0-12-815339-0.00014-7> Contamination of food, wine, and olive oil due to preparation in pewter or lead containers, and addition of sugar lead (sapa) were important causes of lead poisoning. It has been calculated that 50-60% of a free adult Roman’s lead intake probably came from wine. The nobility and the rich, who drank up to 2 L wine per day, would thus have been predisposed to lead poisoning. Pewter ware was extensively used by the middle class. It is calculated that the Roman aristocrat probably took in 250 mg of lead per day, the plebeian 35 mg, and the slave 15 mg. This compares with 30-50 mg of lead per day for the average contemporary adult in the United States. WHO considers 45 mg per day as the maximal lead intake for a healthy individual (Nriagu, 1983; Needleman and Needleman, 1985).

# african non-adoption of the wheel
the "Africans dumb" explanation is circular and absurd: <https://web.archive.org/web/20140106032919/http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/jrobinson/files/the_wheel_in_africa_february_2012.pdf> The conventional notion that Africans failed to employ the wheel because of lack of initiative or intelligence is intellectually unsatisfactory, not so much because it is racialist as because it is circular: Africans are supposed to have ignored the wheel because they were unenterprising, and the evidence that they were unenterprising is that they failed to adopt the wheel. In other contexts, notably in their widespread adoption of the use of imported European firearms, Africans proved eagerly receptive to innovation, and it cannot therefore be argued that they were in general conservative in their responses to new technology. There must, logically, be some special explanation for their lack of interest in the practical application of the technology of wheeled transport.
African civilizations were trapped in a vicious circle (a classic example of the "low-income trap"): <https://www.jstor.org/stable/1159117> But it was nonsensical to advocate the introduction of wheeled transport in order to stimulate road improvement: heavy expenditure on road improvement would only be attractive if wheeled transport promised commensurate savings, and the experience of 1841 might equally reasonably have prompted the discouraging conclusion that the costs involved were so great as to be prohibitive. The costs of road improvement, moreover, would have to be incurred in advance of any savings to be derived from the use of wheeled vehicles, and thus represented a very speculative venture as long as wheeled vehicles were not already in general use. Even the British colonial government in the Gold Coast baulked at the gamble in 1870, concluding that roads suitable for wheeled traffic would be too expensive to build and were in any case undesirable since 'even if good roads were built, there would be no vehicles to travel on them' (Dickson 1971:218-219). **Thus, wheeled transport could not be adopted without improved roads, but the roads would not be improved as long as there was no wheeled transport to use them. Only governments committed to a more aggressive ideology of economic progress, and therefore ready to incur speculative expenses in the confidence of ultimate economic advantage, could break out of this vicious circle; and such governments arrived in West Africa only with the European imperialism of the late nineteenth century.**

With only a few exceptions found in coastal polities incorporated into the empire, there was no trading class in Inca society, and the development of individual wealth acquired through commerce was not possible. Local political units were ideally to be as self-sufficient as possible in producing their own basic economic requirements. A few products deemed essential by the Incas could not be produced locally and had to be imported. In these cases several strategies were employed, such as establishing colonies in specific production zones for particular commodities and permitting limited long-distance trade. The production, distribution, and use of commodities were centrally controlled by the Inca government. Each citizen of the empire was issued the necessities of life out of the state storehouses, including food, tools, raw materials, and clothing, and needed to purchase nothing. With no shops or markets, there was no need for a standard currency or money, and there was nowhere to spend money or purchase or trade for necessities."""

At the same time, one attachment site is commonly affected in males (23.5%) but not in females, that being the origin of the common flexor tendon on the right medial epicondyle.""" """It thus seems likely that the four lesions of the medial epicondyle observed in male individuals of the terminal Upper Paleolithic and Mesolithic reflect the habitual use of throwingbased technology.

Partial recoveries and advances in health occurred during the Bronze Age rise of civilization; then real advance (e.g., a 7-11-year increase in longevity) occurred with the rise of Hellenic-Roman culture."""
^ Angel 1984: skeletons in Greece and Turkey suggest that male and female height declined after the shift to agriculture, male lifespan was unchanged until ~4000 YBP, female lifespan dropped by 1 year until ~4000 YBP, and urbanicity increased enormously (by about 2500x): <https://books.google.com/books/about/Paleopathology_at_the_Origins_of_Agricul.html?id=4cilNAEACAAJ> <https://u1lib.org/book/1216183/7d369d> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/728300132851777546/unknown.png

TODO <https://jasoncollins.blog/2013/06/17/height-through-the-millennia/> """However, this decline in health was not permanent. For example, the health of Egyptians 12,000 years ago, shortly after the shift to farming from foraging, was poor. But by 4,000 years ago, height had returned to pre-agricultural levels and evidence of malnutrition in tooth enamel was lower than that of their hunter gatherer comparators. Agriculturalists adapted to their new diet and environment.""""""Then a funny thing happened on the way from the preagricultural Mediterranean to the giant farms of today: people, at least some of them, got healthier, presumably as we adapted to the new way of life and food became more evenly distributed. The collection of skeletons from Egypt also shows that by 4,000 years ago, height had returned to its preagricultural levels, and only 20 percent of the population had telltale signs of poor nutrition in their teeth. Those trying to make the point that agriculture is bad for our bodies generally use skeletal material from immediately after the shift to farming as evidence, but a more long-term view is starting to tell a different story. For example, Timothy Gage of the State University of New York at Albany examined long-term mortality records from around the world, along with the likeliest causes of death, and concluded that life span did not decrease, nor did many diseases increase, after agriculture. Some illnesses doubtless grew worse after humans settled down, but life has had its “nasty, brutish, and short” phases at many points throughout history.""" [unformatted]

# human population largely failed to grow for 5000 years afterward (this book doesn't cite a source for this claim)
human population rose by only 1 million (from 4 to 5 million) between 10000 BCE and 5000 BCE: <https://www.google.com/books/edition/Against_the_Grain/AJYuDwAAQBAJ> <https://u1lib.org/book/3401043/600996> """The world's population in 10,000 BCE, according to one careful estimate, was roughly 4 million. A full five thousand years later, in 5,000 BCE, it had risen only to 5 million. This hardly represents a population explosion, despite the civilizational achievements of the Neolithic revolution: sedentism and agriculture. Over the subsequent five thousand years, by contrast, world population would grow twentyfold, to more than 100 million. The five thousand-year Neolithic transition was thus something of a demographic bottleneck, reflecting a nearly static level of reproduction. Supposing even a population growth rate just barely over replacement levels (for example, 0.015 percent) the total population would have still more than doubled over these five millennia. One likely explanation for this paradox of apparent human progress in subsistence techniques together with long period of demographic stagnation is that, epidemiologically, this was perhaps the most lethal period in human history. In the case of Mesopotamia, the claim is that, owing precisely to the effects of the Neolithic revolution, it had become the focal point of chronic and acute infectious diseases that devastated the population again and again."""

They make a fairly simple argument. When people shifted to agriculture and faced a greater threat of disease and other hazards associated with dense living, those who were predisposed to make larger investments in health (toward, say, higher investment in immune function or, as they model in their paper, resource transfers to children) would have an evolutionary advantage and increase in prevalence. When those threats to the environment later ease, as has now happened in most advanced economies, that higher investment in health translates into higher life expectancy. """ [unformatted]

Coins came much later, and their use spread only unevenly, never completely replacing credit systems. Barter, in turn, appears to be largely a kind of accidental byproduct of the use of coinage or paper money: historically, it has mainly been what people who are used to cash transactions do when for one reason or another they have no access to currency."""

If no further climate change action will be undertaken, the combined effect of the selected impacts on global annual GDP are projected to rise over time to likely levels of 1.0% to 3.3% by 2060, with a central projection of 2%. This range reflects uncertainty in the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) – a measure indicating how sensitive the earth’s climate reacts to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 – using a likely range of 1.5°C to 4.5°C.

# human survivability and oxygen
with evolution, humans appear able to survive with oxygen pressure as low as half of that today: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5138252/> """The highest permanent settlement on record is the (now abandoned) Chilean mining village of Quilcha (5340 m), which was discovered by the 1935 International High Altitude Expedition to Chile [39]. It has been argued that this represents the upper limit of long-term human habitation, because the residents chose to sleep at this elevation and make a daily ascent to the mine above. PatO2 at the Quilcha settlement is 11.3 kPa (slightly higher than 50% of the current PatO2 at sea level). The parabolic deoxygenation model described here predicts that PatO2 at sea level will reach this threshold in ~3600 years from now. During this time, the human species is likely to undergo further positive selection for physiological phenotypes conveying survival advantage in hypoxic conditions. Studies of high-altitude residents tell us that while such adaptations may enable us to function relatively well in an atmosphere that contains just over half the oxygen we breathe today; many will suffer the long-term consequences."""

A decline in nutrients in the northernmost latitudes coincided with a significant decline in diatoms (North Pacific, −1.00% yr−1) and chlorophytes (North Atlantic, −9.70% yr−1).

# phytoplankton adaptation
one species of phytoplankton rose from 2 to 20% abundance from 1965 to 2010 in the North Atlantic Ocean: <https://science.sciencemag.org/content/350/6267/1533.abstract> <http://sci-hub.se/10.1126/science.aaa8026> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/700875021987610644/unknown.png """`The CPR data shows an increase in occurrence of coccolithophores across the North Atlantic from ~1% of samples in the 1960s to over 20% of samples with coccolithophores in the 2000s (Fig. 1, A to F, and fig.

within 100 generations, a model phytoplankton adapted to the point of equal growth rates in a shift of 20dC to 33dC: <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ele.12545> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/ele.12545> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/700876368124051456/unknown.png """In our experiment, growth rates increased exponentially between 20 and 30 °C after 10 generations, though at 33 °C, the capacity for physiological acclimation to facilitate further increases in growth was insufficient. In line with our expectations, CUE [Carbon-Use Efficiency] declined with increasing selection temperature, and at 33 °C growth was presumably limited by low CUE. Evolutionary responses in phytoplankton, either via selection on pre-existing genotype variation (Lohbeck et al. 2012) or de novo mutations, are frequently observed within 100 generations (Schaum & Collins 2014; Schluter € et al. 2014), and in our experiment, after 100 generations, growth at 33 °C had increased to levels predicted from the exponential relationship between temperature and growth. Consistent with our hypothesis, elevated thermal tolerance evolved via increases in CUE mediated by greater down-regulation of specific rates of respiration, R(Tc) relative to those of photosynthesis, P(Tc). These findings provide direct evidence that selection on metabolic traits provides a mechanistic explanation for the evolution of elevated thermal tolerance in a model phytoplankton."""
The first was published in the journal Science, and looked at data from the past 50 years. The paper's authors found one particular species of phytoplankton from the North Atlantic has thrived. In fact, its population has increased almost tenfold since 1965. That's an incredibly surprising finding for the researchers. It has long been thought that organisms like these would be particularly sensitive to the increase in acidity that is measured in the oceans today. <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/eva.12120> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/eva.12120>
In another study also published this week, researchers like Daniel Padfield from the University of Exeter explored temperature adaptations of plankton. And he says they adapted quickly. "At 33 degrees centigrade, which is the highest temperature where they were stressed out, they initially grew below what we would expect," he said. "However, after just 45 days, they evolved increased growth rates. So essentially, they increased their thermal tolerance, so the range of temperatures in which they're capable of surviving, after only 45 days." <https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo1441> <http://sci-hub.se/10.1038/ngeo1441>
Only up to a point. In a third study published this week, in the Bulletin of Mathematical Biology, researchers from the University of Leicester predicted that a six-degree rise in ocean temperature will prevent phytoplankton from surviving. That would mean the loss of the oxygen they produce through photosynthesis.: <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11538-015-0126-0> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1007/s11538-015-0126-0>

More complex models, for instance, better illustrate the ocean’s circulation patterns, which can have a large effect on warming in the long term.

The collapse of the U.S.S.R. in the 1990s reduced governmental financing of beekeeping in former Soviet countries of eastern Europe, causing a 50% reduction in managed colony numbers there (Aizen and Harder 2009). In western Europe, higher production costs, competition from cheaper imported honey, and increased affordability of sugar-based products have led to a 30% decrease in beekeepers and a 25% decrease in colony numbers since 1985 (Aizen and Harder 2009; Potts et al. 2010a). Honey demand and prices had already fallen in the U.S. at the end of WWII, making beekeeping less profitable. Declines were compounded by rapid expansion of honey importation from China, Argentina, and Vietnam during the 1960s leading to reduced demand for domestic honey (Daberkow et al. 2009; vanEngelsdorp and Meixner 2010). [....] Additionally, long-term declines in the U.S. may be artificially heightened by the counting methods used by the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). A widely cited reduction by one million colonies during the 1980s (Fig. 1) coincides with NASS discontinuing the inclusion of colonies from operations with five or fewer hives (vanEngelsdorp and Meixner 2010)."""

Higher wintertime North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) values in the bloom years correlated well with lower SSTs [sea surface temperatures] and stronger upwelling (Fig. 2) (36, 37). Evidence for nutrient enrichment is also found in the Sargassum nutrient compositions. Specifically, the N:P [nitrogen:phosphorous] ratios of the recent neritic samples show an increasingly P-limited growth compared with the historical baselines, which would be a result of long-term nutrient enrichment, especially N enrichment, in recent years (24). Other evidence to support recent nutrient enrichment in the central west Atlantic comes from increased deforestation and fertilizer use in Brazil and increased water-column nitrogen from 2010 to 2018 (fig. S4)."""

Now in Capital Marx has amply demonstrated that the laws governing wages are very complex, that, according to circumstances, now this law, now that, holds sway, that they are therefore by no means iron but are, on the contrary, exceedingly elastic, and that the subject really cannot be dismissed in a few words, as Lassalle imagined. Malthus’ argument, upon which the law Lassalle derived from him and Ricardo (whom he misinterpreted) is based, as that argument appears, for instance, on p. 5 of the Arbeiterlesebuch, where it is quoted from another pamphlet of Lassalle’s, [9] is exhaustively refuted by Marx in the section on “Accumulation of Capital.” Thus, by adopting the Lassallean “iron law” one commits oneself to a false proposition and false reasoning in support of the same."""

Thereby, the whole bourgeois conception of wages hitherto, as well as all the criticism hitherto directed against this conception, was thrown overboard once and for all. It was made clear that the wage worker has permission to work for his own subsistence—that is, to live, only insofar as he works for a certain time gratis for the capitalist (and hence also for the latter's co-consumers of surplus value); that the whole capitalist system of production turns on the increase of this gratis labor by extending the working day, or by developing the productivity—that is, increasing the intensity or labor power, etc.; that, consequently, the system of wage labor is a system of slavery, and indeed of a slavery which becomes more severe in proportion as the social productive forces of labor develop, whether the worker receives better or worse payment."""

The labour-time that yesterday was without doubt socially necessary to the production of a yard of linen, ceases to be so to-day, a fact which the owner of the money is only too eager to prove from the prices quoted by our friend’s competitors. Unluckily for him, weavers are not few and far between. Lastly, suppose that every piece of linen in the market contains no more labour-time than is socially necessary. In spite of this, all these pieces taken as a whole, may have had superfluous labour-time spent upon them. If the market cannot stomach the whole quantity at the normal price of 2 shillings a yard, this proves that too great a portion of the total labour of the community has been expended in the form of weaving. The effect is the same as if each individual weaver had expended more labour-time upon his particular product than is socially necessary. Here we may say, with the German proverb: caught together, hung together. All the linen in the market counts but as one article of commerce, of which each piece is only an aliquot part. And as a matter of fact, the value also of each single yard is but the materialised form of the same definite and socially fixed quantity of homogeneous human labour."""

# labor theory of value: critique 1: the mainstream theory of general equilibrium
#####o
# summary
The mainstream economic theory of price is a combined supply-side and demand-side model called general equilibrium. Its modern form was formally stated by Ken Arrow and Gerard Debreu in the 1950's. Classical economists Adam Smith and Karl Marx argued that the relative ratio of usual prices (exchange-values) of two goods should be equal to the ratio of labor-time required to usually produce the good. There is no reason to believe price is determined only on the supply side.

# the ltv as a supply-side theory
Roemer: the labor theory of value is a purely supply-side theory of price, but accurate price theories must include demand-side as well: <https://u1lib.org/book/815428/4e2811> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/782280843875319808/roemer1988.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/897508359509512202/unknown.png In fact, the labor theory of value is a supply-side theory, in which prices are thought to be determined entirely by their labor costs; in contrast, emphasizing the importance of the degree to which a commodity fulfills desires or needs or welfare in determining its price is the demand side. The correct theory of market price must take both supply and demand into account. There are some special cases in which demand will not affect price, which is technologically determined, but recourse to those cases should not be sought in an attempt to defend the labor theory of value.
Roemer: the labor theory of value's theoretical foundation (that the only thing in common between commodities is value embodied from labor) is not valid; all products share, at least, the fact that they are desired (a set of use-values): <https://u1lib.org/book/815428/4e2811> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/782280843875319808/roemer1988.pdf>  https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/897508330614980608/unknown.png

It tells us that in two different things - in 1 quarter of corn and x cwt of iron, there exists in equal quantities something common to both.** The two things must therefore be equal to a third, which in itself is neither the one nor the other.

Neither can it any longer be regarded as the product of the labour of the joiner, the mason, the spinner, or of any other definite kind of productive labour.

The labour-time that yesterday was without doubt socially necessary to the production of a yard of linen, ceases to be so to-day, a fact which the owner of the money is only too eager to prove from the prices quoted by our friend’s competitors. Unluckily for him, weavers are not few and far between. Lastly, suppose that every piece of linen in the market contains no more labour-time than is socially necessary. In spite of this, all these pieces taken as a whole, may have had superfluous labour-time spent upon them. If the market cannot stomach the whole quantity at the normal price of 2 shillings a yard, this proves that too great a portion of the total labour of the community has been expended in the form of weaving. The effect is the same as if each individual weaver had expended more labour-time upon his particular product than is socially necessary. Here we may say, with the German proverb: caught together, hung together. All the linen in the market counts but as one article of commerce, of which each piece is only an aliquot part. And as a matter of fact, the value also of each single yard is but the materialised form of the same definite and socially fixed quantity of homogeneous human labour."""

If under normal, i.e., average social conditions of production, a pounds of cotton ought to be made into b pounds of yarn by one hour’s labour, then a day’s labour does not count as 12 hours’ labour unless 12 a pounds of cotton have been made into 12 b pounds of yarn; for in the creation of value, the time that is socially necessary alone counts. Not only the labour, but also the raw material and the product now appear in quite a new light, very different from that in which we viewed them in the labour-process pure and simple.

# labor theory of value: magarino quotes
#####o
Magarino: LTV explains relative prices: <https://youtu.be/0fLdVq4eCYc?t=206> The labor theory of value is clearly not a scientfic theory in the sense of belonging to natural sciences, but it is is a scientific theory as it belongs to the social sciences. It is a theory that tries to explain something about political economy. And what exactly does it try to explain? It tries to explain relative prices in capitalist societies where commodity exchange is generalized.
Magarino: LTV explains the fundamental value of a commodity (around which actual market prices fluctuate): <https://youtu.be/0fLdVq4eCYc?t=428> The definition of value, in Marx, is abstract socially necessary labor time. And this being value, what he now does is say, this is actually going to say a lot about the way in which commodities exchange against one another in the market. And as we are going to see, he's goign to build the prices of production based on this labor, and these are going to be basically the fundamental prices, so these are going to be, in the same way that the fundamental value of a stock in financial theory is the total sum of dividends discounted at the interest rate, in the labor theory of value, we say that the fundamental value of a commodity is this price of production, which is the center of gravity of the actual market price. So it's not going to be necessarily equal, but it's going to the the regulator of market prices, but this is actually testable.
Magarino: LTV applies only to commodities, which are objects which people desire to exchange: <https://youtu.be/0fLdVq4eCYc?t=531> Marx makes it very clear in the first chapter of Das Kapital, that commodities are useful objects, and therefore people want to purchase them. If someone doesn't want to purchase an object, that object cannot be a commodity, because a commodity is a use value that has an exchange value. If an object has no use value, no one wants to buy it, it cannot have an exchange value, and it's therefore not a commodity.

# alternative explanation for exploitation
market socialist Roemer demonstrates that the labor theory of value is unnecessary to explain exploitation, which can instead simply is the proportion of a worker's output that is not paid back to that worker: <https://u1lib.org/book/815428/4e2811> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/782280843875319808/roemer1988.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/787365053317382154/unknown.png
Roemer therefore argues that exploitation is a property relation; put another way, exploitation results from scarce capital ownership (few machines) and abundant labor ownership (many workers): <https://u1lib.org/book/815428/4e2811> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/782280843875319808/roemer1988.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/787365135106572288/unknown.png

# other substances than labor can also be exploited
Roemer: the labor theory of value relies on the idea that labor is the only common property of commodities; this is absurd: <https://u1lib.org/book/815428/4e2811> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/782280843875319808/roemer1988.pdf> """Marx argued that the one property that all commodities had in common was their production by "abstract labor." It is hard to see why this should be regarded as the one property that all produced commodities have in common. They also share the property of being desired by people; and that property gives rise to a welfare-based theory of value (which is reflected in the statement occurring in neoclassical economic theory that prices are proportional to marginal utilities)."""
Roemer: mathematically, exploitation of labor is equivalent to exploitation of any other commodity; the only difference is that exploitation of labor might have normative problems: <https://u1lib.org/book/815428/4e2811> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/782280843875319808/roemer1988.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/787366894851457054/unknown.png

Kliman 2002 then adjusts the price and value of each sector by its aggregate labour and non-labour costs (which is agreat proxy for industry size): <https://academic.oup.com/cje/article-abstract/26/3/299/1711462> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/cje/26.3.299> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/787155135120801852/kliman2002.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/787166363571453952/unknown.png

Kliman also demonstrates that transforming the values in the way they propose (dividing by total cost) would still produce values in line with theory, if the theory were correct: <https://academic.oup.com/cje/article-abstract/26/3/299/1711462> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/cje/26.3.299> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/787155135120801852/kliman2002.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/787168870120423444/unknown.png """Table 2 also shows that the simulations closely mirror theoretical expectations. This is important to emphasise because it has been suggested (OPE-L Archives, Feb.–Mar., 1999; see esp. posts 439, 443, 457 and 476) that deflation of prices and values by costs destroys a valid relationship between them. The source of the problem is supposedly that costs and values are too highly correlated. Yet although the simulations assumed value– cost correlations almost identical to the actual ones, they yielded average values for the intercept and slope terms extremely close to those predicted by theory, as well as small standard deviations. This again demonstrates that, if the labour theory of relative prices were true, the price–value relationship would be preserved under transformation."""

# marx quotes on source of alienation
<https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/labour.htm> """All these consequences are implied in the statement that the worker is related to the product of his labor as to an alien object. For on this premise it is clear that the more the worker spends himself, the more powerful becomes the alien world of objects which he creates over and against himself, the poorer he himself – his inner world – becomes, the less belongs to him as his own. It is the same in religion. The more man puts into God, the less he retains in himself. The worker puts his life into the object; but now his life no longer belongs to him but to the object. Hence, the greater this activity, the more the worker lacks objects. Whatever the product of his labor is, he is not. Therefore, the greater this product, the less is he himself."""

The other hypothesis, emphasizing loss of control over the process of labor, suggests that (at least within an industrialized, capitalist society) such determinants of occupational selfdirection as closeness of supervision, routinization, and substantive complexity overshadow ownership, hierarchical position, and division of labor in their effects on alienation"""

Marx 1894: the rise of publicly-traded companies has eliminated the need for direct manager-capitalist owners: <https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1894-c3/ch23.htm> """The wages of management both for the commercial and industrial manager are completely isolated from the profits of enterprise in the co-operative factories of labourers, as well as in capitalist stock companies.

Just as the development of bourgeois society witnessed a separation of the functions of judges and administrators from land-ownership, whose attributes they were in feudal times. But since, on the one hand, the mere owner of capital, the money-capitalist, has to face the functioning capitalist, while money-capital itself assumes a social character with the advance of credit, being concentrated in banks and loaned out by them instead of its original owners, and since, on the other hand, **the mere manager who has no title whatever to the capital, whether through borrowing it or otherwise, performs all the real functions pertaining to the functioning capitalist as such, only the functionary remains and the capitalist disappears as superfluous from the production process.**"""

Thereby: [....] Transformation of the actually functioning capitalist into a mere manager, administrator of other people's capital, and of the owner of capital into a mere owner, a mere money-capitalist. Even if the dividends which they receive include the interest and the profit of enterprise, i.e., the total profit (for the salary of the manager is, or should be, simply the wage of a specific type of skilled labour, whose price is regulated in the labour-market like that of any other labour), this total profit is henceforth received only in the form of interest, i.e., as mere compensation for owning capital that now is entirely divorced from the function in the actual process of reproduction, just as this function in the person of the manager is divorced from ownership of capital.""" """In stock companies the function is divorced from capital ownership, hence also labour is entirely divorced from ownership of means of production and surplus-labour.

Marx 1859: mankind proceeds through "Asiatic", "ancient", "feudal", and "bourgeois" epochs of modes of production: <https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/preface.htm> """Mankind thus inevitably sets itself only such tasks as it is able to solve, since closer examination will always show that the problem itself arises only when the material conditions for its solution are already present or at least in the course of formation. In broad outline, the Asiatic, ancient,[A] feudal and modern bourgeois modes of production may be designated as epochs marking progress in the economic development of society. The bourgeois mode of production is the last antagonistic form of the social process of production – antagonistic not in the sense of individual antagonism but of an antagonism that emanates from the individuals' social conditions of existence – but the productive forces developing within bourgeois society create also the material conditions for a solution of this antagonism. The prehistory of human society accordingly closes with this social formation."""

"""Savagery – the period in which man’s appropriation of products in their natural state predominates; the products of human art are chiefly instruments which assist this appropriation.

Both suggestions leave much to be desired. The former contends that Marx’s ethics are ultimately personal and arbitrary, even though, throughout his life, Marx emphasised the social dimensions of life, and argued that communism would be founded upon a rational, non-arbitrary, basis.

Secondly, it is often noted that Marx was not, as one would expect a scientist to be, a neutral, dispassionate observer in his writings. This is as evident in his writings on political economy as it is in his newspaper articles. In Capital, for example, he condemns the egoism, exploitation, estrangement, degradation, etc. which capitalism brings in its train. Marx’s writings are pervaded by a normative and partisan atmosphere. His commitment to the particular kind of social order which he sees his work as advancing is always obvious and constantly present. Further, this commitment is not simply a personal commitment, but one which he clearly believes that others should share.

At the most we have various sections in larger works, paragraphs, and scattered comments on ethics and morality which are interwoven with his reflections on history, economics, and politics. Further, on those occasions on which he does speak of ethics he does not engage in moral reflection as traditional and contemporary moral philosophers have. He does not pose for himself the question, ‘What ought I to do?’ as a way of entering into moral reflection. He does not set out, as Kant and others have, to search for and establish the supreme principle of morality by argument and consideration of the reasons and views of others. Thus, he does not, in any obvious way, urge the universalisation of the maxims of our actions (as Kant did) or the calculation of the greatest good our actions might promote (as J.S. Mill did). Such individual questions are quite secondary to Marx’s concern for the social system within which people raise such questions. Nor does Marx attempt to develop a theory of the meaning and purpose of moral statements as individuals make them. As such, Marx was not a moral philosopher. There are few, I think, who would deny this. However, it does not follow that Marx did not have a moral theory. A person may be said to have a moral theory, even though he may never have explicitly formulated it.

# moralism with performative non-moralism: marx rejected morality to distinguish himself, but accepted it
Wolff and Leopold 2021: Marx goes beyond "theoretical necessity" in critiquing morality (and refusing to use it as a justifier) in order to distinguish himself from contemporary reformist socialists and bourgeois do-gooders: <https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/marx/> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/877965566143504495/unknown.png https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/877965631171989574/unknown.png """Marx wanted to distance himself from these other socialist traditions, and a key point of distinction was to argue that the route to understanding the possibilities of human emancipation lay in the analysis of historical and social forces, not in morality.""" """Communism clearly advances human flourishing, in Marx’s view. The only reason for denying that, in Marx’s vision, it would amount to a good society is a theoretical antipathy to the word “good”. And here the main point is that, in Marx’s view, communism would not be brought about by high-minded benefactors of humanity. Quite possibly his determination to retain this point of difference between himself and other socialists led him to disparage the importance of morality to a degree that goes beyond the call of theoretical necessity."""

For there exist texts, ably exploited by Wood, which suggest that, at least when writing them, Marx thought all non-relativist notions of justice and injustice were moonshine. If the texts really show that he thought so, then I would conclude that, at least sometimes, Marx mistakenly thought that Marx did not believe that capitalism was unjust, because he was confused about justice. (The italicized thesis is misreported, in two different ways, at pp. 9 and 42 of Marx and Morality (op. cit.) because of bad (copy?) editing.) At one point Wood approaches a thesis about Marx on capitalism and justice which resembles the one just stated, but he retreats from it on the ground that 'there is no sign that Marx sees anything morally wrong or unjust about . . . capitalism' (p. I5'). I think calling it 'robbery' is such a sign, and that saying 'Capitalist justice is truly to be wondered at!' (Capital, Volume I, op cit., p. 66o), with the sense the remark carries in its context, is another one."""
^ Wolff and Leopold 2021: summary of Cohen 1983: <https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/marx/> In other words, Marx, like so many of us, did not have perfect knowledge of his own mind. In his explicit reflections on the justice of capitalism he was able to maintain his official view. But in less guarded moments his real view slips out, even if never in explicit language.

They represented to him a kind of dream-like acquiescence in the face of the increasing degradation suffered by larger and larger numbers of people in modern society. Either they amounted to a kind of simple moralism in which moral conclusions were drawn, society was condemned or criticised, but (after all this) everything remained simply as it was. Or they amounted to an attempt to justify the status quo. [....] This opposition to the ineffectiveness, as well as the illusions, of morality and ethics can be found throughout Marx’s writings[.] [....] With regard to moral philosophy, Marx’s well-known eleventh thesis on Feuerbach captures his view perhaps most succinctly: ‘The philosophers have only interpreted the world; the point, however, is to change it’ (Theses on Feuerbach). As opposed to the moral philosophers and moralists of his time, Marx insisted that any creditable critical theory of man and society must clearly distinguish between appearance and reality. It must relentlessly pursue and analyse ‘the common wisdom’ for the realities it conceals. Furthermore, such an account must show how human society really operates, how it can be and must be changed. In short, any critical science must be illusionless and effective."""

We do not find an effect of the left–right position of the main center right competitor on social democratic support. We replicated this analysis breaking the left–right down into separate economic and social dimensions—see Appendix Table A6—and we found that social democratic parties won more votes when they were more free market on the economic dimension but more conservative on the social dimension. These results challenge some existing research, for example, that there is little evidence of the link between parties’ positions and their electoral performance (e.g., Adams 2012) and Kitschelt ’s (1990) contention that social democrats should gain support as they become leftlibertarian. However, further investigation reveals that this result on the social dimension is mainly driven by parties in Central and Eastern Europe (after 1989), where several parties, in Romania and Slovakia for example, became socially conservative from the early 2000s and gained votes at the expense of more liberalcosmopolitan parties. In contrast, there is little evidence in Western Europe of a connection between social democratic parties’ positions on a social dimension and their electoral performance."""

Then these data were corroborated with multiple sources, including encyclopedias, case studies, and a comprehensive bibliography on nonviolent civil resistance by April Carter, Howard Clark, and Michael Randle (2006). Finally, we consulted with experts in the field, who suggested any remaining conflicts of note. The resulting list includes major campaigns that are primarily or entirely nonviolent. Campaigns where a significant amount of violence occurred are not considered nonviolent. Violent campaign data are derived primarily from Kristian Gleditsch’s (2004) updates to the Correlates of War (COW) database on intrastate wars, Jason Lyall and Isaiah Wilson’s (2009) database of insurgencies, and Kalev Sepp’s (2005) list of major counterinsurgency operations.

While conventional militaries use violence to advance political goals, in this book we are concerned with the use of unconventional violent strategies used by nonstate actors. 11 These strategies are exhibited in three main categories of unconventional warfare: revolutions, plots (or coups d’état), and insurgencies, which differ according to the level of premeditated planning, protractedness, and means of overthrowing the existing order. 12 The weapons system available to an armed insurgent is very different from that of its nonviolent analogue. Violent tactics include bombings, shootings, kidnappings, physical sabotage such as the destruction of infrastructure, and other types of physical harm of people and property. However, the cases we examine do not include military coups, since we are primarily interested in substate actors that are not part of the state.

For our study, to be considered a “success” a campaign had to meet two conditions: the full achievement of its stated goals (regime change, antioccupation, or secession) within a year of the peak of activities and a discernible effect on the outcome, such that the outcome was a direct result of the campaign’s activities (Pape 1997). The second qualification is important because in some cases the desired outcome occurred mainly because of other conditions. The Greek resistance against the Nazi occupation, for example, is not coded as a full success even though the Nazis ultimately withdrew from Greece. Although effective in many respects, the Greek resistance alone cannot be credited with the ultimate outcome of the end of Nazi influence over Greece since the Nazi withdrawal was the result of the Allied victory rather than solely Greek resistance."""

Following Ackerman and Kruegler (1994, 10–11), we define a campaign as a series of observable, continual tactics in pursuit of a political objective. A campaign can last anywhere from days to years. Campaigns have discernible leadership and often have names, distinguishing them from random riots or spontaneous mass acts. 14 Usually campaigns have distinguishable beginning and end points, as well as discernible events throughout the campaign. In the case of resistance campaigns, beginning and end points are difficult to determine, as are the events throughout the campaign. In some cases, information on such events is readily available (e.g., Northern Ireland from 1969 to 1999); however, in most cases, it is not.

The coefficients in columns 1 to 6 are roughly similar in magnitude to those from table 2A, but the estimated riot-effect profile is somewhat steeper in the quadratic specifications of columns 1 to 3 (reaching an impact of -0.22 in column 1 at a riot index value of 0.3). Likewise, column 4 estimates an average “severe riot city” effect of about 12 percent (compared to 9 percent in table 2A), and again, the 2SLS coefficients increase in magnitude, as do the associated standard errors.""""""77 percent of the deaths in the base sample occurred in the “severe” riot cities.

The 2SLS coefficients are uniformly negative, economically large, and remain near conventional levels of statistical significance. Given the relatively large standard errors, it is not surprising that Durbin-WuHausman tests cannot decisively reject the exogeneity of the severity variable, but the test statistics are large enough (p-values of 0.14 for 1960-70 and 0.27 for 1960-80) that we are reluctant to ignore the 2SLS suggestion that the true effects are larger than the OLS estimates."""

In the most advanced land of capitalism and political liberty, the British bourgeoisie (who as far back as the seventeenth century settled accounts with the absolute monarchy in a rather democratic way) managed in the nineteenth century to split the British working-class movement. In the middle of the nineteenth century Britain enjoyed an almost complete monopoly in the world market. Thanks to this monopoly the profits acquired by British capital were extraordinarily high, so that it was possible for some crumbs of these profits to be thrown to the aristocracy of labour, the skilled factory workers. This aristocracy of labour, which at that time earned tolerably good wages, boxed itself up in narrow, self-interested craft unions, and isolated itself from the mass of the proletariat, while in politics it supported the liberal bourgeoisie. And to this very day perhaps nowhere in the world are there so many liberals among the advanced workers as in Britain."""

For the states passing same-sex marriage at the state level, the demonstrated pattern was identical to that evident in models 1–3 (Fig. 3). Bias decreased at roughly double the rate over time following legalization (B = −0.0112, SE = 0.0006, P < 0.001).

[....] In states that did not pass same-sex marriage legalization locally, we find a reactive or “backlash” effect (27) such that federal legalization was associated with increased antigay bias over time, despite the decreasing trend in bias in these states before federal legalization. The specific factors driving this effect cannot be addressed by the present data. One possibility is that, even though attitudes were improving, a tipping point of local support had not yet been reached for the majority to accept the federal ruling. Research at the individual level suggests that the attention given the federal decision may have sharpened some respondents’ sense of symbolic threat to their lifestyle and values (43), and this sense of threat could have exacerbated antigay biases among those individuals.

# summary
Marx and Engels never accepted reformism, but they shifted towards accepting it over time, particularly as they saw the successes of universal suffrage and the German Social Democratic Party.

# researcher opinions
Hollander 2010: Marx and Engels increasingly supported the reformist route to socialism over time: <https://www.jstor.org/stable/41802465> <https://sci-hub.se/10.2307/41802465> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/865759002133397544/hollander2010.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/865760815215018004/unknown.png """First, the 1895 Introduction does not itself signify a major change in Engels' attitude considering his recognition, not late in the day but over several decades, of political concessions by the British ruling class in particular, in effect its surrender to the proletariat regarding the suffrage. Secondly, since from the 1840s Marx noted and applauded the potential of the 'Social Democratic' route, at least under the appropriate conditions - including national character - Engels was scarcely deviating from the master and certainly not belatedly so. Indeed, some of Marx's affirmations are quite as strong as those of Engels in 1895."""
Hollander 2010: however, Marx and Engels held that parliamentary victory should be followed by pursuing Communist goals, preparing a dictatorship of the proletariat in law and force, and therefore preventing the removal of the party from government: <https://www.jstor.org/stable/41802465> <https://sci-hub.se/10.2307/41802465> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/865759002133397544/hollander2010.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/865760822017523793/unknown.png """[T]here are certainly limits to Engels' revisionism. Thus it is misleading to speak of his having in 1895 'fully accepted the democratic viewpoint', since the parliamentary route was only the most effective means - and only under certain conditions - of assuring a 'dictatorship of the proletariat'. And most important, the immediate goal of a parliamentary majority was to establish, or at least set the foundations for, a classless communist system, on which matter there was no compromise; thus Engels would have found unacceptable a Parliamentary system generating a working-class majority unwilling to carry out a Communist program - Engels' support for Universal Suffrage as means to achieve proletarian power presupposes that elected workers tow the party line - or a working-class electorate choosing to replace the party at the polls. Such outcomes would render the 'dictatorship' a contradiction in terms. [...] Furthermore, insofar as our authors justified the use of force to protect the 'dictatorship' once in place - and however achieved - from counter-revolution, there remains some consolation for those traditionalists who view them as red in tooth and claw."""

# engels quotes: reform is impossible even to acheive universal suffrage
Engels 1842: "the middle class will never renounce its occupation of the House of Commons by agreeing to universal suffrage": <https://marxists.architexturez.net/archive/marx/works/1842/12/08.htm> <https://u1lib.org/book/2484909/e76c23> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/865761516204457994/mecw2.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/865761998414675988/unknown.png """And if a revolution in England is impossible, as they at least assert, they have indeed little to fear for their rule. If Chartism has the patience to wait until it has won a majority in the House of Commons, it will have to go on for many a year to come holding meetings and demanding the six points of the People’s Charter [180]; the middle class will never renounce its occupation of the House of Commons by agreeing to universal suffrage, since it would immediately be outvoted by the huge number of the unpropertied as the inevitable consequence of giving way on this point. Therefore Chartism has not yet been able to gain any hold among educated people in England and will remain unable to do so for some time yet."""
Engels 1842: "in England’s present condition, “legal progress” and universal suffrage would inevitably result in a revolution": <https://marxists.architexturez.net/archive/marx/works/1842/12/08.htm> <https://u1lib.org/book/2484909/e76c23> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/865761516204457994/mecw2.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/865762482701205514/unknown.png """Moreover, irrespective of political interests, the middle class can only be Whig or Tory, never Chartist. Its principle is the preservation of the status quo; in England’s present condition, “legal progress” and universal suffrage would inevitably result in a revolution. It is therefore quite natural that the practical Englishman, for whom politics is a matter of arithmetic or even a commercial affair, pays no attention at all to the power of Chartism, which is quietly growing to formidable proportions, since it cannot be expressed in numbers, except perhaps in such as, in relation to the government and Parliament, would be noughts after the decimal point. But there are things which are beyond numerical calculation, and it is here that the super-cleverness of English Whiggery and Toryism will suffer a debacle, when the time comes."""

# engels quotes: communist power may be achieved either peacefully or violently
Engels 1847: peaceful achievement of socialism is desirable, but unlikely: <https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/11/prin-com.htm> <https://u1lib.org/book/2484914/d8029d> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/886729538795601940/mecw6.pdf> """Question 16: **Will the peaceful abolition of private property be possible? It would be desirable if this could happen, and the communists would certainly be the last to oppose it.** Answer: Communists know only too well that all conspiracies are not only useless, but even harmful. They know all too well that revolutions are not made intentionally and arbitrarily, but that, everywhere and always, they have been the necessary consequence of conditions which were wholly independent of the will and direction of individual parties and entire classes. But they also see that the development of the proletariat in nearly all civilized countries has been violently suppressed, and that in this way the opponents of communism have been working toward a revolution with all their strength. If the oppressed proletariat is finally driven to revolution, then we communists will defend the interests of the proletarians with deeds as we now defend them with words."""
Engels 1847: description of "democratic socialism" as modern "social democrats" (not abolishing capitalism, merely ensuring that capitalism is humane): <https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/11/prin-com.htm> <https://u1lib.org/book/2484914/d8029d> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/886729538795601940/mecw6.pdf> """Question 24: How do communists differ from socialists? Answer: The so-called socialists are divided into three categories. [....] Finally, the third category consists of democratic socialists who favor some of the same measures the communists advocate, as described in Question 18, not as part of the transition to communism, however, but as measures which they believe will be sufficient to abolish the misery and evils of present-day society. These democratic socialists are either proletarians who are not yet sufficiently clear about the conditions of the liberation of their class, or they are representatives of the petty bourgeoisie, a class which, prior to the achievement of democracy and the socialist measures to which it gives rise, has many interests in common with the proletariat. It follows that, in moments of action, the communists will have to come to an understanding with these democratic socialists, and in general to follow as far as possible a common policy with them – provided that these socialists do not enter into the service of the ruling bourgeoisie and attack the communists. It is clear that this form of co-operation in action does not exclude the discussion of differences."""

# marx quote: reform is possible in certain institutions

[....] Do they then forget that America will be the workers' continent par excellence, that half a million men -- workers -- emigrate there yearly, and that on such soil, where the worker dominates, the International is bound to strike strong roots?"""

# marx quote: the state of the future
Marx 1875: <https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/ch04.htm> <https://u1lib.org/book/2484971/053dce> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/865284162122285076/mecw24.pdf> """The question then arises: What transformation will the state undergo in communist society? In other words, what social functions will remain in existence there that are analogous to present state functions? This question can only be answered scientifically, and one does not get a flea-hop nearer to the problem by a thousand-fold combination of the word 'people' with the word 'state'. Between capitalist and communist society there lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other. Corresponding to this is also a political transition period in which the state can be nothing but the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat. Now the program does not deal with this nor with the future state of communist society. Its political demands contain nothing beyond the old democratic litany familiar to all: universal suffrage, direct legislation, popular rights, a people's militia, etc. They are a mere echo of the bourgeois People's party, of the League of Peace and Freedom. They are all demands which, insofar as they are not exaggerated in fantastic presentation, have already been realized. Only the state to which they belong does not lie within the borders of the German Empire, but in Switzerland, the United States, etc. This sort of "state of the future" is a present-day state, although existing outside the "framework" of the German Empire."""
Marx 1875: taxes are the basis of government machinery and nothing else; income taxes presuppose multiple social classes: <https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/ch04.htm> <https://u1lib.org/book/2484971/053dce> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/865284162122285076/mecw24.pdf> """That, in fact, by the word "state" is meant the government machine, or the state insofar as it forms a special organism separated from society through division of labor, is shown by the words "the German Workers' party demands as the economic basis of the state: a single progressive income tax", etc. Taxes are the economic basis of the government machinery and of nothing else. In the state of the future, existing in Switzerland, this demand has been pretty well fulfilled. Income tax presupposes various sources of income of the various social classes, and hence capitalist society. It is, therefore, nothing remarkable that the Liverpool financial reformers — bourgeois headed by Gladstone's brother — are putting forward the same demand as the program."""

# engels quote: free trade
Engels on Marx's views on free trade: <https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1888/free-trade/> """From this point of view, 40 years ago Marx pronounced, in principle, in favor of Free Trade as the more progressive plan, and therefore the plan which would soonest bring capitalist society to that deadlock. But if Marx declared in favor of Free Trade on that ground, is that not a reason for every supporter of the present order of society to declare against Free Trade? If Free Trade is stated to be revolutionary, must not all good citizens vote for Protection as a conservative plan? If a country nowadays accepts Free Trade, it will certainly not do so to please the socialists. It will do so because Free trade has become a necessity for the industrial capitalists. But if it should reject Free Trade and stick to Protection, in order to cheat the socialists out of the expected social catastrophe, that will not hurt the prospects of socialism in the least. Protection is a plan for artificially manufacturing manufacturers, and therefore also a plan for artificially manufacturing wage laborers. You cannot breed the one without breeding the other."""

# summary
Eltis 2000 (ch8): summary of Marxist collapse theory: falling rate of profit + overaccumulation --> increasingly slow growth and increasingly strong crises: <https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-0-230-59820-1_8> <https://u1lib.org/book/1197196/66937f> <http://bookszlibb74ugqojhzhg2a63w5i2atv5bqarulgczawnbmsb6s6qead.onion/book/1197196/66937f> So Marx's theory of the tendency of the rate of profit and the growth of employment to decline can make little sense to economists today. His proposition that wages will rise less than productivity, if at all, is still more irrelevant to an understanding of how modern economies develop. Mainstream economics therefore almost wholly ignores Marx's explanations and predictions of the broad historical tendencies.

# theory of accumulation was common: see eg keynes on overaccumulation
John Maynard Keynes, 1936 General Theory of Employment, lnterest and Money, pp. 1 29-1 3 l: When involuntary unemployment exists, the marginal disutility of labour is necessarily less than the utility of the marginal product. [ ... ] Pyramid-building, earthquakes, even wars may serve to increase wealth, if the education of our slatesmen on the principles of the classical economics stands in the way of anything better. [ ... ]Just as wars have been the only form of large-scale loan expenditure which statesmen have thought justifiable, so gold-mining is the only pretext for digging holes in the ground which has recommended itself to bankers as sound finance; and each of these activities has played its part in progress - failing something better. Ancient Egypt was doubly fortunate, and doubtless owed to this its fabled wealth, in that it possessed two aclivities, namely pyramid-building as weil as the search for precious metals, the fruits of which, since they could not serve the needs of man by being consumed, did not stale with abundance.

She was anything but a subscriber to Kautsky's notion of a mechanical dialectic (in his Road to Power). As Geras points out, Luxemburg equated barbarism with the collapse of capitalism - a collapse that, if unchallenged, would doom all civilization to extinction. The need for revolutionary activity was all the greater if extinction was to be avoided. The supersession of capitalism [by socialism] was a "necessity" in the sense that without it we are all doomed, not in the sense that it would inevitably follow the collapse of capitalism."""

It is the threat of the constant fall of the rate of profit, resulting not only from the contradiction between production and exchange, but from the growth of the productivity of labour itself. The fall in the rate of profit has the extremely dangerous tendency of rendering impossible any enterprise for small and middle-sized capitals. It thus limits the new formation and therefore the extension of placements of capital."""
Luxemburg 1915: However, Luxemburg also thought that the falling rate of profit was so slow that it would never cause the collapse of capitalism: <https://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1915/anti-critique/ch02.htm> <https://u1lib.org/book/873136/99b0de> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/792819104238927882/luxemburg1915.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/891445589164847184/unknown.png """[W]e are left with the somewhat oblique comfort provided by a little ‘expert’ from the Dresdener Volkszeitung who, after thoroughly destroying my book, explains that capitalism will eventually collapse ‘because of the falling rate of profit’. One is not too sure exactly how the dear man envisages this – whether the capitalist class will at a certain point commit suicide in despair at the low rate of profit, or whether it will somehow declare that business is so bad that it is simply not worth the trouble, whereupon it will hand the key over to the proletariat? However that may be this comfort is unfortunately dispelled by a single sentence by Marx, namely the statement that ‘large capitals will compensate for the fall in the rate of profit by mass production’. **Thus there is still some time to pass before capitalism collapses because of the falling rate of profit, roughly until the sun burns out.**"""

# delaying catastrophe: imperialism expands markets universally

[....] The ever-growing capacity of the export industries requires the products of Department I, thus maintaining investment at home. [....] The process of building up this capital provides an outlet for the old industries and rescues them from the contradictions inherent in deficiency of demand."""
Luxemburg 1913: Luxemburg argues the drive to accumulate causes capitalist countries, via imperialism, to expand capitalist markets to the entire world; but because capitalism (allegedly) cannot absorb its own surplus value, this will cause capitalism to collapse: <https://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1913/accumulation-capital/ch29.htm> <https://u1lib.org/book/2064926/d8244b> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/792770224738402314/luxemburg1913.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/884245548520079370/unknown.png """The premises which are postulated in Marx’s diagram of accumulation accordingly represent no more than the historical tendency of the movement of accumulation and its logical conclusion. [....] Its ultimate aim, that is to say, is to establish the exclusive and universal domination of capitalist production in all countries and for all branches of industry. Yet this argument does not lead anywhere. As soon as this final result is achieved — in theory, of course, because it can never actually happen — accumulation must come to a stop. The realisation and capitalisation of surplus value become impossible to accomplish. Just as soon as reality begins to correspond to Marx’s diagram of enlarged reproduction, the end of accumulation is in sight, it has reached its limits, and capitalist production is in extremis. For capital, the standstill of accumulation means that the development of the productive forces is arrested, and the collapse of capitalism follows inevitably, as an objective historical necessity. This is the reason for the contradictory behaviour of capitalism in the final stage of its historical career: imperialism."""
Luxemburg 1915: imperialism prolongs capitalism's existence: <https://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1915/anti-critique/ch06.htm> <https://u1lib.org/book/873136/99b0de> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/792819104238927882/luxemburg1915.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/891439779739234375/unknown.png """Imperialism is as much a historical method for prolonging capital's existence as it is the surest way of setting an objective limit to its existence as fast as possible. This is not to say that the final point need actually be attained. The very tendency of capitalist development towards this end is expressed in forms which make the concluding phase of capitalism a period of catastrophes. The more ruthless1y capital uses militarism to put an end to noncapitalist strata in the outside world and at home, the more it depresses the conditions of existence of all working strata, the more the day-today history of capital accumulation on the world stage changes into an endless chain of political and social catastrophes and convulsions; these latter, together with the periodic economic catastrophes in the shape of crises, make continued accumulation impossible and the rebellion of the international working class against the rule of capital necessary, even before it has economically reached the limits it set for itself."""

[Luxemburg] then sets out a fresh model allowing for technical progress. The rate of exploitation (the ratio of surplus to wages) is rising, for real wages remain constant while output per man increases. [....] But there is no need to paddle in the arithmetic to find where the difficulty lies. The model is over-determined because of the rule that the increment of capital within each department at the end of a year must equal the saving made within the same department during the year. If capitalists from Department II [produces consumption goods] were permitted to lend part of their savings to Department I [produces capital, "means of production"] to be invested in its capital, a breakdown would no longer be inevitable. Suppose that total real wages are constant and that real consumption by capitalists increases slowly, so that the real output of Department II rises at a slower rate than productivity, then the amount of labour employed in it is shrinking. The ratio of capital to labour however is rising as a consequence of capital-using technical progress. The output of Department I, and its productive capacity, is growing through time. Capital invested in Department I is accumulating faster than the saving of the capitalists in Department I, and capitalists of Department II, who have no profitable outlet in their own industries for their savings, acquire titles to part of the capital in Department I by supplying the difference between investment in Department I and its own saving. For any increase in the stock of capital of both departments taken together, required by technical progress and demand conditions, there is an appropriate amount of saving, and so long as the total accumulation required and total saving fit, there is no breakdown."""
Robinson 1968: This converts capitalist collapse from "historic necessity" to historic contingency: Under Luxemburg's model, stagnation *may* happen if capitalist savings-investment rates demand rates of accumulation higher than technical progress can sustain: <https://u1lib.org/book/2064926/d8244b> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/792770224738402314/luxemburg1913.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/884482122042204190/unknown.png """But here we find the clue to the real contradiction. These quantities might conceivably fit, but there is no guarantee that they will. If the ratio of saving which the capitalists (taken together) choose to make exceeds the rate of accumulation dictated by technical progress, the excess savings can only be ‘capitalised’ if there is an outlet for investment outside the system. [....] Once more we can substitute for a supposed logical necessity a plausible hypothesis about the nature of the real case, and so rescue the succeeding argument. If in reality the distribution of income between workers and capitalists, and the propensity to save of capitalists, are such as to require a rate of accumulation which exceeds the rate of increase in the stock of capital appropriate to technical conditions, then there is a chronic excess of the potential supply of real capital over the demand for it and the system must fall into chronic depression."""

All the same, few would deny that the extension of capitalism into new territories was the mainspring of what an academic economist has called the ‘vast secular boom’ of the last two hundred years,56 and many academic economists account for the uneasy condition of capitalism in the twentieth century largely by the ‘closing of the frontier’ all over the world.57"""

In that case socialism ceases to be a historic necessity. It then becomes anything you want to call it, but it is no longer the result of the material development of society."""

Long before this, the objective tendency of capitalist development in this direction is sufficient to produce such a social and political sharpening of contradictions in society that they must terminate. But these social and political contradictions are essentially only a product of the economic indefensibility of capitalism.

The Kremlin quickly fingered the Chechens as the perpetrators.7""""""Polls conducted after the terrorist attacks showed that Russians were almost twice as likely to believe that Chechen motives were now to "kill Russians," "bring Russia to its knees," "destabilize the situation in Russia," "destroy and frighten Russian society," and "bring chaos to Russian society" than to achieve "the independence of Chechnya."77""""""Popular support for war remained remarkably stable after the bombings; six months after they occurred, 73 percent of Russians favored "the advance of federal forces into Chechnya," compared with only 19 percent of Russians who wanted "peaceful negotiations with the Chechen leadership."83 Since 2000, support for President Putin's Chechnya policy has not dropped below 67 percent.8"""

The revolt from December 1987 to January 1991 killed only twenty Israeli civilians.""""""Edy Kaufman has noted that "the primary purpose of the first intifada was to communicate to Israelis the need to end the occupation of the territories."113 Terrorist acts, even in small numbers, interfered with the message. Throughout the intifada, only 15 percent of Palestinian demonstrations were violent.114 Yet an absolute majority of Israelis (80 percent) believed that the means employed by the Palestinians to protest Israeli rule were "mainly violent." Of the violent Palestinian acts, the vast majority consisted of rock throwing against the Israel Defense Forces in the territories, with few incidences of terrorism inside the Green Line. An even broader consensus of Israelis (93 percent) felt that the intifada was directed "both towards civilians and towards the army."'11""""""Compelling evidence suggests, however, that terrorism informed the Israeli view of Palestinian objectives. In a fascinating study based on the polling data contained in the Guttman report, Kaufman observed that the respondents who perceived Palestinian tactics as "mainly violent" were more likely to believe that the Palestinian goal was to "destroy Israel." Conversely, the more Israelis perceived Palestinian tactics as nonviolent, the more they believed the goal was to liberate the territories. The positive correlation between perceived Palestinian terrorism and maximalist objectives existed independent of the respondents' political affiliation, suggesting that the association was not a function of their preexisting political attitudes.11"""

In comparison, right-wing terrorist attacks caused 335 deaths, left-wing attacks caused 22 deaths, and ethnonationalist terrorists caused 5 deaths. To evaluate the ongoing threat from different types of terrorists, however, it is useful to consider the proportion of fatalities attributed to each type of perpetrator annually. In 14 of the 21 years between 1994 and 2019 in which fatal terrorist attacks occurred, the majority of deaths resulted from right-wing attacks. In eight of these years, right-wing attackers caused all of the fatalities, and in three more—including 2018 and 2019—they were responsible for more than 90 percent of annual fatalities.11 Therefore, while religious terrorists caused the largest number of total fatalities, right-wing attackers were most likely to cause more deaths in a given year"""

a consensus study by the National Academies finds that immigration to the US increases economic growth and doesn't reduce wages: <https://www.nap.edu/catalog/23550/the-economic-and-fiscal-consequences-of-immigration>

# employment and wages: meta-analysis
Longhi 2010: a meta-analysis of seven immigration studies finds almost no effect on native wages or native employment: <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10109-010-0111-y> <http://sci-hub.se/10.1007/s10109-010-0111-y> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/495039000365760525/unknown.png We find small wage and employment impacts, even smaller than have been detected in previous metaanalytic research. A 1% point increase in the share of immigrants in a local labour market of the typical host country decreases wages of the native born by 0.029% (using a weighted average with weights determined by the precision of the estimates) and decreases employment of the native born by 0.011%.

# employment and wages: single studies
immigration to the US slightly increases wages for natives, slightly decreases wages for low-education natives, and significantly decreases wages for immigrants: <https://academic.oup.com/jeea/article/10/1/152/2182016> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1542-4774.2011.01052.x> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/495037831949975553/m_jeea0152-08.png In the long run, these estimates imply an overall average positive effect of immigration on native wages of about 0.6% and an overall average negative effect on the wages of previous immigrants of about −6%. [....] All in all, one finding seems robust: once imperfect substitutability between natives and immigrants is allowed for, over the period 1990–2006 immigration to the United States had at most a modest negative long-run effect on the real wages of the least educated natives. This effect is between −2.1% and +1.7% depending on the chosen nesting structure, with the positive results coming from the nesting structure preferred by the data. Our finding at the national level of a small wage effect of immigration on less-educated natives is in line with the findings identified at the city level.
immigration is a net positive for the economy, but unequally benefits the high-skilled: <https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/589756> <http://sci-hub.se/10.1086/589756> The wage effects are sizeable but plausible: a 10 percent increase in the number of low-skilled immigrants in a city reduces the wages of low-skilled natives by 0.6 percent and of low-skilled immigrants by 8 percent (an own-labor demand elasticity of -1.2). My results imply that the low-skilled immigration wave of the 1990s increased the purchasing power of high-skilled workers living in the 25 largest cities by an average of 0.65 percent and decreased the purchasing power of native high school dropouts by an average of 2.66 percent. I conclude that, through lower prices, low-skilled immigration brings positive net benefits to the US economy as a whole, but generates a redistribution of wealth: it reduces the real income of low-skilled natives and increases the real income of high-skilled natives.

# tax payments of illegal immigrants
illegal immigrants paid $11.7bn in state and local taxes in 2014: <https://www.vox.com/2019/3/1/18241692/undocumented-immigrants-pay-state-local-taxes> <https://itep.org/wp-content/uploads/immigration2017.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/566247990876962827/Undocumented_immigrant_tax_contributions2.png
about half of illegal immigrants pay taxes, and they pay at rates close to what they would pay if they were legal: <https://itep.org/wp-content/uploads/undocumentedtaxes.pdf> Undocumented immigrants currently contribute significantly to state and local taxes, collectively paying an estimated $10.6 billion in 2010 with contributions ranging from less than $2 million in Montana to more than $2.2 billion in California. This means these families are likely paying about 6.4 percent on average of their income in state and local taxes. Allowing undocumented immigrants to work in the United States legally would increase their state and local tax contributions by an estimated $2 billion a year. Their effective state and local tax rate would also increase to 7 percent on average, which would put their tax contributions more in line with documented taxpayers with similar incomes.
people without social security numbers paid $23.6bn in income taxes in 2015: <https://www.vox.com/2019/3/1/18241692/undocumented-immigrants-pay-state-local-taxes> <http://taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/Media/Default/Documents/2015ARC/ARC15_Volume1_MSP_18_ITIN.pdf>

# controlling for age
accounting for age, migrants in Germany had similar suspect rates as Germans: <https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-72159-0_26> <http://sci-hub.se/10.1007/978-3-319-72159-0_26> """If one would attribute the increase in crime that was observed in 2015 entirely to the refugees that entered Germany in this year, this would lead to a rate of suspects per 100.00 (Tatverdächtigenbelastungszahl, TVBZ) of 5800 for this group of refugees. This rate for Germans was 2124. Hence, the rate for refugees would be considerably higher than the rate for the Germans. But if we take a closer look at the rate of Germans aged between 16 and 30 (which is the age group most closely to that of refugees), one comes to another conclusion. Here, the rate for Germans ranges between 4200 and 5800, so absolutely in the range that is calculated (though inadequately) when observing refugees only. If we apply these numbers to those offenses that seem to matter most to the public (such as burglaries and sexual assaults), then the increase of non-German suspects (and especially of refugees) is considerably lower than one would initially have expected."""

# scope of crime committed by asylum seekers
in 2015, 1% of police reports are attributed to asylum seekers and 1.8% of the Swedish population were asylum seekers <http://cpsblog.isr.umich.edu/?p=1905> If asylum-seekers are particularly crime-prone, then we would expect to see crime rates in which they are overrepresented relative to how many are living in Sweden. Sweden hosted approximately 180,000 asylum-seekers during this period and the population of Sweden is approximately 10 million. Therefore, asylum-seekers make up approximately 1.8% of the people living in Sweden, while 1% of the police reports filed in STORM were attributed to asylum-seekers.

# rape: police report data
according to police reports data in Sweden, the rape rate hasn't significantly changed between 2008 and 2015 (the rape law was reformed in 2005): <http://politicalviolenceataglance.org/2017/04/19/what-crime-data-from-sweden-can-and-cannot-tell-us/> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/640936603195539466/Screen-Shot-2017-04-05-at-5.png
according to police reports data in Sweden, the rate of rape has only slightly increased since 2015 (the rape law was reformed in 2005): <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkjkU2w6jhw> <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Rnn3Ur8ofYRAIlexfvbc_HXaH7kkWczm> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/567774881043841081/unknown.png

# rape: convictions data
the number of convictions for rape has been basically flat since 2005: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_in_Sweden> The number of convictions has remained relatively unchanged since 2005, with approximately 190 convictions on average each year.[9][10] The total number of convictions for rape and aggravated rape in Sweden 2015 was 176.

# sexual assault
Sweden changed its definition of sexual assault in 2005 and in 2013 <https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/02/24/no-sweden-isnt-hiding-an-immigrant-crime-problem-this-is-the-real-story/> <http://archive.is/T5IuS> In Sweden, the legal definition of sexual assault is much broader than it is in the U.S. and even other European countries. While the rate of rape has remained steady in Sweden over the past decade, changes to the legal definition of sexual assault in 2005 and 2013 resulted in increases in reported sexual assault — because more acts now fall within the legal definition and are therefore officially counted. Thus, the standard of accountability has increased.
2005 reform: After, sex with a person in a "helpless state" (e.g. intoxicated, asleep) was sexual assault: <https://www.regeringen.se/49bb66/contentassets/a0f8b372714a4377a1a507e50f0c3666/en-ny-sexualbrottslagstiftning>
2013 reform: Previously, sex with a person in "helpless state" was sexual assault; after, a person in a "particularly vulnerable situation" was sexual assault. <https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-lagar/arende/betankande/en-skarpt-sexualbrottslagstiftning_H001JuU20>

# don't cite the swedish crime survey

why not to use SCS (NTU) data: <http://politicalviolenceataglance.org/2017/04/19/what-crime-data-from-sweden-can-and-cannot-tell-us/> Many people responded to our articles by citing data from the National Crime Survey (NTU) on an increase from 1% to 1.7% in sexual assault. In doing so, they misunderstood the important distinction between sexual offense and rape. While the NTU survey includes a question about rape, it has not released the raw data or discussed the findings. There are two likely reasons for this. First, there are so few cases of rape in the survey data that they cannot confidently make estimates about its occurrence in the population. Second, the authors of the report believe that respondents’ perceptions may not be accurate reflections of the legal distinctions between various categories of sex offenses. While the NTU is not confident in making precise estimates of the occurrence of rape, it does believe the data are sufficient to conclude that the rate of rape and other forms of coercive sexual offenses (“sexuellt tvång”) is higher than data from the police reports indicate. This means that there is underreporting by victims. Unfortunately, we cannot estimate how the probability of a victim reporting a sexual offense event has changed from year to year, and this affects our ability to draw conclusions about trends in the rape data.

# inclusivist founder quotes about "posterity"
John Adams: immigrants must "shed their European skin" (ie, preference for privilegia) for American equal rights: <https://thefederalist.com/2014/08/18/what-john-quincy-adams-said-about-immigration-will-blow-your-mind/> <https://archive.org/stream/nilesweeklyregis18balt#page/157/mode/1up> Emigrants from Germany, therefore, or from elsewhere, coming here, are not to expect favors from the governments. They are to expect, if they choose to become citizens, equal rights with those of the natives of the country. They are to expect, if affluent, to possess the means of making their property productive, with moderation, and with safety;—if indigent, but industrious, honest and frugal, the means of obtaining easy and comfortable subsistence for themselves and their families. [....] To one thing they must make up their minds, or, they will be disappointed in every expectation of happiness as Americans. They must cast off the European skin, never to resume it. They must look forward to their posterity, rather than backward to their ancestors; they must be sure that whatever their own feelings may be, those of their children will cling to the prejudices of this country, and will partake of that proud spirit, not unmingled with disdain, which you have observed is remarkable in the general character of this people, and as perhaps belonging peculiarly to those of German descent, born in this country.
George Washington: the USA should be an "asylum to the virtuous and persecuted": <https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/04-06-02-0266> I had always hoped that this land might become a safe & agreeable Asylum to the virtuous & persecuted part of mankind, to whatever nation they might belong; but I shall be the more particularly happy, if this Country can be, by any means, useful to the Patriots of Holland, with whose situation I am peculiarly touched, and of whose public virtue I entertain a great opinion.

# exclusivist founder quotes about "posterity"
Benjamin Franklin: Anglo-Saxons are white, "Spaniards, Italians, French, Russians", "Swedes", and "Germans" are "tawny" and should not be "increased in number": <http://www.columbia.edu/~lmg21/ash3002y/earlyac99/documents/observations.html> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/955635117269860372/unknown.png Which leads me to add one Remark: That the Number of purely white People in the World is proportionably very small. All Africa is black or tawny. Asia chiefly tawny. America (exclusive of the new Comers) wholly so. And in Europe, the Spaniards, Italians, French, Russians and Swedes, are generally of what we call a swarthy Complexion; as are the Germans also, the Saxons only excepted, who with the English, make the principal Body of White People on the Face of the Earth. I could wish their Numbers were increased. And while we are, as I may call it, Scouring our Planet, by clearing America of Woods, and so making this Side of our Globe reflect a brighter Light to the Eyes of Inhabitants in Mars or Venus, why should we in the Sight of Superior Beings, darken its People? why increase the Sons of Africa, by Planting them in America, where we have so fair an Opportunity, by excluding all Blacks and Tawneys, of increasing the lovely White and Red? But perhaps I am partial to the Compexion of my Country, for such Kind of Partiality is natural to Mankind.

# statistics: overall
farm murders have never been lower than now, according to the South African Police Service (this number includes all murders of all people (owners, workers, visitors, family) on all farms, including smallholdings (but not nonfarming smallholdings)); note the gap of 2007-2009: <https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/farm-murder-rate-lowest-in-20-years-remoteness-the-reason-for-brutality-20180531> <https://africacheck.org/factsheets/factsheet-statistics-farm-attacks-murders-sa/> <https://www.farmersweekly.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/AgriSA_Farm-Attacks_V1.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/574722108915974185/unknown.png
SA has 35000 commercial farm owners, 10300 family members of commercial farm owners, 771000 commercial farm employees, and 4000000 smallholding farm owners: <https://www.news24.com/Columnists/GuestColumn/afriforums-own-farm-murder-stats-dont-support-their-claims-20180507> <https://www.nda.agric.za/docs/statsinfo/Censcoagric2007.pdf> <https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/212633/2/Pienaar-Understanding%20the%20smallholder%20farmer%20in%20South%20Africa-1233.pdf> The number of "farm murders" is 47; this includes smallholders. Using different definitions of "farmer" results in wildly different murder rates. Including just commercial farm owners, we get 134 murders per 100000. Including family, 103 per 100000. Including workers, 5.75 per 100000. Including smallholders, 0.975 per 100000. SA's murder rate is 34 per 100000 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_in_South_Africa>
alternately, AfricaCheck argues that statistic calculation is impossible: <https://africacheck.org/2017/05/08/analysis-calculating-farm-murder-rate-sa-near-impossible/> Previously, Burger used Statistics South Africa’s 2007 census of commercial agriculture’s estimate of 32,375 full-time farmers to indicate the murder rate of farmers. This was how he calculated that there were 133 farm murders per 100,000 farmers, using the Transvaal Agricultural Union of South Africa’s estimate of 39 farmers murdered in 2012. Chris van Zyl, the union’s assistant general, told Africa Check that the recorded murders included farmers on non-commercial farms and agricultural smallholdings. Burger excluded family members, workers and visitors from the calculation. However, the 2007 figure of 32,375 full-time farmers is not appropriate to use, as the survey was only conducted on commercial farms registered to pay value-added tax (VAT). [....] The survey also estimated that there were an additional 10,272 family members involved in farming activities, 4,923 owners in partnership directly involved in farming activities and 770,933 paid employees. Including the full-time farmers, this added up to 818,503. If this farming population is used, the farm murder rate for 2015/16 would be 5.6 murders per 100,000 people living and/or working on farms registered to pay value-added tax. However, the total population of people living on farms and smallholdings, which do not pay value-added tax, will be larger.

# statistics: race
the Boer-dominated Transvaal Agricultural Union's data on farm murders shows a very variable white farm murder count, making trend analysis difficult: <https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-05/fact-check-were-400-white-south-african-farmers-murdered-year/9591724> <https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4428330-Farm-Murders-Racial-Breakdown-1990-2018.html> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/574720347585380362/unknown.png
according to the South African Police Service, 74% of farm murders were white and 83% were farm owners: <https://africacheck.org/factsheets/factsheet-south-africas-crime-statistics-for-2017-18/> In 2017/18, the police recorded 62 murders during 58 attacks. Of those murdered, 52 were the owners or occupiers of the farm/smallholding, 9 were farm workers and one was a farm manager. Forty-two murders took place on farms, 15 on smallholdings and one at a cattle post. The majority of the murder victims (46) were white.

# statistics: reliability
reliability (or lack thereof) of the statistics: <https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-05/fact-check-were-400-white-south-african-farmers-murdered-year/9591724> Dr de Kock told Fact Check that the police's farm murder count was reliable. But he said the "biggest problem" with the data was that police stations do not specifically record hate-based murders or "farm murders". "So a murder, wherever that murder happens, whatever the motive for that murder, will just be registered as a murder." Dr de Kock also pointed out that more than half of farm attacks or murders take place on "small holdings", usually plots of one or two hectares on the edge of towns and cities. "In many cases people don't actually farm on those," he said, explaining that while some people might farm on a small scale, "strictly speaking [they're] no commercial farmer". Dr Burger said the lack of regular government statistics on farm attacks and murders makes it "extremely difficult to accurately define the extent of the problem". But he also said the union works hard to ensure the credibility of its data, which he relies on himself. And according to Dr Burger, murder statistics reported by different groups tended to be similar.

The statemetn is made bearing in mind all research conducted in previous hearings and governmetn commissions of inquiries. Racial tensions have been present in South Africa for many decades and continue to be the case in democratic South Africa. [.....] Safety and security challenges persist in farming communities. Violence in farming communities is not based on the ground of race but reflects a reality where issues of racial segregation, land tenure, and economic [dis]empowerment provide the context for considering the root causes of crime which occur in farming communities. In addition, the Commission notes that the term "farm attacks and/or murder" i[s] inappropriate.

# background: eisenhower 1954 plan
Herbert Brownell, Attorney General under Eisenhower, announced in 1954 (!) that only immigrants who posed a risk to national security, to public safety, or of fleeing their trial would be detained: <https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/ag/legacy/2011/09/12/11-11-1954.pdf> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/852279875858333696/11-11-1954.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/941877170517721158/unknown.png
as a result, the number of people in immigration detention fell dramatically: in 1955, there were just four (!!) people in immigration detention seeking entry to the US: <https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/ag/legacy/2011/09/12/01-26-1955.pdf> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/941886234719035452/01-26-1955.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/941886289244987402/unknown.png
the policy was so notable that in 1958 the Supreme Court claimed that "this policy [of non-detention] reflects the humane qualities of an enlightened civilization": <https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/357/185.html> <https://archive.ph/wip/jtzWg> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/941887052297957406/unknown.png

# background: start of modern mass detention

When the US did a trial program very similar to this proposal it was extremely successful. That's because mass detention is not just inhumane, it's unnecessary!

# the problem
CHGO = civilian household gun ownership
[1] CHGO has many, large negative health outcomes: Higher suicide, higher homicide, higher accidents, associated economic costs
[2] CHGO has few, small positive health outcomes: Individual hunting, individual target practice
[3] CHGO has little impact on outcomes for democracy, freedom, worker power, and minority power

# the solutions: consumer side
[1] Short-term: Legalize most or all drugs, end poverty via welfare, shift justice system from retributive to rehabilitative: Reduce violent crime in general, reducing gun deaths
[2] Short-term: Make gun licenses mandatory for new gun purchases, waiting periods mandatory: Significantly reduce suicide and homicide by delaying purchase, and overall gun levels by increasing difficulty of purchase (6 states: DC, CA, WA, IL, MA, NY)
[3] Short-term: Make gun safes mandatory for new gun purchases: Enormously reduce household gun theft, which is the primary source of illegal guns
[4] Short-term: Enact domestic violence restraining/protection order (DVRO or DVPO) gun relinquishment laws: Significantly reduce intimate partner homicide, the 2nd largest category of gun violence
[5] Short-term: Enact extreme risk protection order (ERPO) gun relinquishment laws: Allows family members, police to petition a court that someone's firearms present a risk to themselves or others; Significantly reduce suicide, may reduce mass shootings
[6] Short-term: Prohibit gun purchases among people under 21: 70% of murder occurs before offenders reach 30 years old; restricting guns from younger people may significantly reduce homicide
[7] Long-term: Shift ownership entirely from CHGO to community armories: Maintain right to bear arms while reducing likelihood of theft, suicide, or homicide

# the solutions: producer side
[8] Short-term: Increase taxes on civilian gun factories and fund voluntary gun buybacks: Reduces gun levels and is easily worth it (guns cause $176bn/yr in damages)
[9] Long-term: Prohibit commercial gun production: Requires less state coercion than seizing guns from houses and significantly reduces future gun supply

# good existing law
[0] Short-term: Enact serious crime gun relinquishment laws: Persons convicted of serious crimes (over 1y in prison) should be prohibited from gun ownership (49 states, Vermont does violent crime only)

In 1998, legislation was introduced in the United Kingdom that required analgesics to be blister packaged and reduced pack sizes to non-lethal doses. Limits on the number of packs that could be bought in a single transaction were also enforced, the aim being to reduce household supplies of paracetamol which might be available for impulsive overdose. It is particularly interesting that this relatively simple intervention appeared to have a considerable impact on suicide rates, resulting in a 64% reduction of severe paracetamol overdoses and a 21% reduction of overall paracetamol overdoses (Turvill, Burroughs, & Moore, 2000). These changes persisted, with little evidence of substitution over three years following the restriction, resulting in the estimated prevention of approximately 200 deaths (Hawton, 2002)."""

We integrated these data into a single epidemiologic analysis of nearly 65000 medically identified suicide attempts and 11000 suicides to compute annual incidence of suicide acts and case fatality rates in 8 states, by victim age, sex, and race and by method used. [....] Choice of method plays a role in the lethality of the suicide act. Firearm is the most lethal method and drug overdose/poison ingestion the least lethal.

What this table discloses is that after 26-plus years the vast majority of GGB [Golden Gate Bridge] suicide attempters (about 94%) are still alive or have died from natural causes. The comparison group of hospital cases has had similar experiences; 89% are still alive or are dead from natural means after 15 years. Conversely, only five to seven percent killed themselves and some six to 11% had died from all violent causes combined. Even if we compensate for underenumeration by doubling our frequencies it still means that about 90% of the study subjects were alive or had come to a natural non-violent end."""

ineffective because firms just increase productions: <http://www.bapress.ca/Journal/Gun%20Buybacks%20and%20Firm%20Behavior--%20Do%20Buyback%20Programs%20Really%20Reduce%20the%20Number%20of%20Guns.pdf> <http://web.archive.org/web/20191110180037/http://www.bapress.ca/Journal/Gun%20Buybacks%20and%20Firm%20Behavior--%20Do%20Buyback%20Programs%20Really%20Reduce%20the%20Number%20of%20Guns.pdf> Thus, any anticipated (repeated) buyback’s impact on future stock levels of firearms depends critically on the commit ability of the durable-goods manufacturer, independent of the buyers’ reselling and arbitrage activities. Moreover, regardless of commitment ability, the model suggests the imperfectly competitive firms may, at least partially, counteract the buyback program, making any governmental buyback less effective at reducing future firearm stocks than expected.

symbolic racism predicts firearm ownership: <http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0077552> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/639990209194360841/image.png In wave 20 of the ANES, participants were asked to respond to a four-item scale drawn from the Symbolic Racism Scale [37]. Specifically, participants indicated the extent to which they agree (1=agree strongly to 5=disagree strongly) with statements such as “Generations of slavery and discrimination have created conditions that make it difficult for blacks to work their way out of the lower class” (reverse scored). Scores on the four items were coded so that high scores are indicative of elevated levels of symbolic racism. A test of the reliability of the scale showed the four items corresponded closely with each other as indicated by a Cronbach’s alpha level of 0.8 and the emergence of a single factor from exploratory factor analysis of the scale. We utilized the average score across the four items to produce a scale ranging 1=lowest symbolic racism score, to 5=highest symbolic racism score.
higher opposition to gun regulations is predicted by higher symbolic racism, higher firearm ownership, higher libertarianism, lower egalitarianism, and lower income: <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11109-015-9326-4> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1007/s11109-015-9326-4> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/639991539585515530/unknown.png

# stolen firearms
based on surveys of firearm owners, ~460,000 firearms are stolen from individuals every year: <https://www.rsfjournal.org/content/3/5/38.abstract> <https://www.rsfjournal.org/content/rsfjss/3/5/38.full.pdf> Approximately 2.4 percent of gun owners (CI: 1.6–3.6) reported having had one or more stolen from them in the past five years, the mean number at 1.9 (a range of 1 to 6). Assuming that theft was evenly distributed across the years, we estimate that approximately 2.3 million guns were stolen over the past five years (five hundred thousand annually).
Hemenway Azrael Miller 2017: in 2015, based on a survey of 3949 firearm owners, ~380,000 firearms are stolen from individuals every year; gun owners who reported safely storing their guns were 3x less likely to report gun thefts: <https://injepijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40621-017-0109-8> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1186/s40621-017-0109-8> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/980582562101596190/hemenway2017.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/980582741320028160/unknown.png """Among gun owners, 2.4% report having one or more guns stolen in the past 5 years (Table 1). The mean number of guns stolen per incident was 1.5(95% CI: 1.0,2.0). Using data from the April 2015 survey, we estimated that 22% of US adults are gun owners (Azrael et al. 2015), consistent with findings from the General Social Surveys from the University of Chicago’s National Opinion Research Center (Smith and Son 2015). Using these results, and given approximately 242 million adults lived in the US (average for 2011–2015), we estimate that there were 1.2 million incidents of gun theft over a 5-year period, or about 250,000 incidents per year. With 1.5 guns stolen per incident, we estimate that approximately 380,000 guns (95% CI 260,000,510,000) were stolen per year."""
based on FBI crime statistics, ~320,000 firearms are stolen from individuals and gun stores every year: <https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/guns-crime/reports/2017/07/25/436533/stolen-guns-america/> Gun theft is not a minor problem in the United States. According to data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), during the four-year period from 2012 to 2015, nearly half a billion dollars worth of guns were stolen from individuals nationwide, amounting to an estimated 1.2 million guns. Twenty-two thousand guns were stolen from gun stores during this same period.

unformatted, unread: firearm control is effective at reducing illegal firearm ownership and trafficking to other states: <https://www.rsfjournal.org/doi/full/10.7758/RSF.2017.3.5.01>: Because an estimated 270 million guns are in private hands nationwide, effective control is said to be beyond reach (Azrael et al. 2017). But this “futility” claim is in our judgment based on a misunderstanding of how guns come to be used in criminal violence. Despite that the number of private guns is enough to arm every adult, the great majority of adults (78 percent) do not in fact own one. **The main concern should be less about the current stock of guns in private hands and more about the flow of guns: the ease of obtaining one for criminal purposes.** [....] Real-world markets tend to be a good deal messier than Economics 101 reveals, and underground markets particularly so. [....] **[T]he money price is not the only or necessarily the most important cost to obtaining a gun outside the formal market. Other types of transactions costs are relevant, including the search time required for the buyer and seller to find each other, the payments to a broker or other intermediary, and the risk of arrest.** [....] We report evidence suggesting that in some respects the underground market is sensitive to regulation. For example, **when Virginia adopted a one gun per month maximum on handgun sales to any one customer, that state’s prominence as a “source” state in trafficking to Massachusetts and other states with relatively stringent regulations dropped sharply** (see Braga 2017).

# use in crime
most firearm used in crimes come from household thefts: <https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-criminol-032317-092149> Guns are legal commodities, but violent offenders typically obtain their guns by illegal means. Our knowledge of these transactions comes primarily from trace data on guns recovered by the police and from occasional surveys of gun-involved offenders. **Because most guns used in crime are sourced from the stock of guns in private hands (rather than a purchase from a licensed dealer), the local prevalence of gun ownership appears to influence the transaction costs and the proportions of robberies and assaults committed with guns rather than knives or other weapons**. Nonetheless, regulations that govern licensed dealers have been linked to trafficking patterns and in some cases to the use of guns in crime.
of gun trafficking incidents, 32-34% involved guns stolen from stores or residences: <https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/guns-crime/reports/2017/07/25/436533/stolen-guns-america/> A 2000 ATF report that reviewed all firearms trafficking investigations undertaken by the agency between July 1996 and December 1998—the most recent such study the agency has conducted—found that nearly 14 percent of those cases involved guns stolen from licensed gun dealers and another 10 percent involved guns stolen from private residences.11 These investigations involved more than 9,300 illegally trafficked guns.12 Another study analyzed data on 893 guns recovered by the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Firearms Trafficking Unit in 2008 and found that for close to 32 percent of these firearms, their original owners claimed they had been stolen.13

# united states
the seriously mentally ill don't disproportionately commit crimes (4% population, 4% crimes) and they use less firearms in the crimes they do commit: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4318286/> [S]urprisingly little population-level evidence supports the notion that individuals diagnosed with mental illness are more likely than anyone else to commit gun crimes. **According to Appelbaum,25 less than 3% to 5% of US crimes involve people with mental illness, and the percentages of crimes that involve guns are lower than the national average for persons not diagnosed with mental illness.** Databases that track gun homicides, such as the National Center for Health Statistics, similarly show that fewer than 5% of the 120,000 gun-related killings in the United States between 2001 and 2010 were perpetrated by people diagnosed with mental illness.26 [....] [A] number of the most common psychiatric diagnoses, including depressive, anxiety, and attention-deficit disorders, have no correlation with violence whatsoever.18 **Community studies find that serious mental illness without substance abuse is also “statistically unrelated” to community violence.40** At the aggregate level, the vast majority of people diagnosed with psychiatric disorders do not commit violent acts—only about 4% of violence in the United States can be attributed to people diagnosed with mental illness.41,42

# lone wolves
the vast majority of violence is not done by "loners": <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4318286/> Contrary to the image of the marauding lone gunman, social relationships also predict gun violence. Regression analyses by Papachristos et al. demonstrate that up to 85% of shootings occur within social networks.60 In other words, **people are far more likely to be shot by relatives, friends, enemies, or acquaintances than they are by lone violent psychopaths.** Meanwhile, a report by the police department of New York City found that, in 2013, a person was “more likely to die in a plane crash, drown in a bathtub or perish in an earthquake” than be murdered by a crazed stranger in that city.61

# poor prediction by psychologists
psychologists are bad at predicting gun violence: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4318286/: [R]esearch dating back to the 1970s suggests that psychiatrists using clinical judgment are not much better than laypersons at predicting which individual patients will commit violent crimes and which will not. [....] Thirty-three years later, Swanson put it even more succinctly: **“psychiatrists using clinical judgment are not much better than chance at predicting which individual patients will do something violent and which will not.”**31,45 [unformatted]

# summary of two-part: congressional research service
Peck 2019: <https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/details?prodcode=R44618> <https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R44618/14> """Generally, the courts have adopted a two-step framework for evaluating Second Amendment challenges. First, courts ask whether the regulated person, firearm, or place comes within the scope of the Second Amendment’s protections. If not, the law does not implicate the Second Amendment. But if so, the court next employs the appropriate level of judicial scrutiny—rational basis, intermediate, or strict scrutiny—to assess whether the law passes constitutional muster. In deciding what level of scrutiny is warranted, courts generally ask whether the challenged law burdens core Second Amendment conduct, like the ability to use a firearm for self-defense in the home. If a law substantially burdens core Second Amendment activity, courts typically will apply strict scrutiny. Otherwise, courts generally will apply intermediate scrutiny. Most challenged laws have been reviewed for intermediate scrutiny, where a court asks whether a law is substantially related to an important governmental interest."""

# two-part test is judicial consensus
Charles 2019: the two-part test is near-unanimous consensus among Circuit of Appeals judges: <https://sites.law.duke.edu/secondthoughts/2019/08/16/where-are-all-the-second-amendment-circuit-splits> """Take the question of how Second Amendment challenges ought to be adjudicated. The courts of appeals have uniformly adopted a two-part test: courts ask first whether activity or conduct is protected by the Second Amendment and, if it is, they apply some form of means-end scrutiny to determine constitutionality. Although some circuit judges have advocated rejecting the two-part test in favor of a “text, history, and tradition” approach (including then-Judge Kavanaugh), no federal court of appeals has adopted that framework—or any methodology that jettisons the two-part test. That could change in the current Second Amendment challenge pending in the Supreme Court, but for now the methodological question is settled."""

# two-part test approach: being applied!
Ruben and Blocher 2018: application of the two-part test has remained constant at around 45% of cases; this may undercount the true rate, as courts may not explicitly state that they are applying the first step: <https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2018/5/23/17383644/second-2nd-amendment-gun-control-debate-santa-fe-parkland-heller-anniversary-constitution> <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3165011> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/875838683981414451/ruben2018.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/875838783050874930/unknown.png """There are good reasons to suppose that these results underreport the influence and adoption of the two-part test, however, at least within the federal courts. Just 32 percent of state appellate challenges applied the two-part test, compared with 46 percent of federal challenges. Moreover, as in other areas, courts may not be explicit when they are using the two-part test—many of the cases that involve the application of tiered scrutiny might actually be instances of courts assuming coverage and skipping to the second step.243 Finally, the percentage of cases applying the two-part test increased steadily after 2012. This may reflect the growing impact of circuit opinions expressly adopting this decisional framework.244 Of the nine circuits that expressly adopted the two-part test, six did so in 2011 or later.245"""

# unanimous court support for certain prohibitions
Charles 2019: every court of appeals has agreed that large-capacity magazine bans, assault weapon bans, prohibited person bans (felon bans, domestic violence bans), unusual weapon bans, and machine gun bans: <https://sites.law.duke.edu/secondthoughts/2019/08/16/where-are-all-the-second-amendment-circuit-splits/> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/978857068909957160/unknown.png """The circuit courts have also largely agreed on specific types of Second Amendment challenges. Without exception, every federal court of appeals to have considered the question has upheld a ban on large-capacity magazines (indeed, a district judge in California recently “became the first federal court in the nation to invalidate LCM restrictions”).  The courts of appeals have uniformly upheld bans on so-called “assault weapons.” (Some have done so under Step 1, ruling that “assault weapons” have no Second Amendment protection whatsoever; others have done so under Step 2, upholding the bans under intermediate scrutiny.) These courts have, in addition, consistently rejected facial challenges to the  firearms prohibition for felons—and many other categories of prohibited persons: “Facial challenges to the statute’s constitutionality have failed in every circuit to have considered the issue.” They have consistently rejected challenges to laws banning, or tightly regulating, possession of certain types of dangerous and unusual weapons. For example, “Every post-Heller circuit court that has addressed the machine gun issue has rejected Second Amendment claims.” The amount of agreement over such a wide swath of regulations is noteworthy."""

# statistical court support for prohibitions by category

The court in one of the two cases denied a motion to dismiss a complaint challenging Illinois’s safe storage law, but noted that the plaintiffs “may face an uphill battle on the merits of their claim” at later stages.223 The claim then became moot and was dismissed after a plaintiff in the case moved to another state.224 In the other case, the court remanded for the trial court to apply heightened scrutiny to Ohio’s vehicle storage law.225 On remand and in a subsequent appeal, the law was upheld.226"""

^ the protocols were a notorious fake: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion> """Mr. Simons. There is a gentleman here in America who last night called on me. [....] He asked me whether I knew anything about the anti-Christian element in the Bolshevik regime. I said, "Indeed, I do. I do know all about it." He said, "Did you ever come across the so-called Jewish protocols?" I said, "Yes; I have had them." "I have a memorandum," he said, "and last win- ter after much trouble I came into possession of a book which was called 'Eedusti, anti-Christ.' "Now, Dr. Houghton in the mean- time had investigated this. He had come into possession of this book, which is quite rare now, because it was said that when the edition came out it was immediately bought up by the Jews in Petrograd and Moscow. That book reflects a real organization. That book is of some consequence. But the average person in official life here in Washington and elsewhere is afraid to handle it. Houghton says that even in his intelligence bureau they were afraid of it."""

Herman Greife was a Russian German who published books for the Nazis and was a member of the SS: <https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%93%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B9%D1%84%D0%B5,_%D0%93%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BD> """From there he moved to the Institute for the Study of Eastern Europe (Wannsee-Institute), which was part of the SD structure, where in 1936-1937 he was the manager of affairs[4], and where from September 1938 to 1940 he worked with the Deputy Director of the Institute for Research Mikhail Akhmeteli[1]. During his work in these think tanks, Greife created a number of works devoted to the ideology and political philosophy of the Soviet Union, as well as the history of Soviet statehood and a number of subjects of contemporary Soviet reality. In 1937 he published the author of a sharply anti-Semitic and anti-Soviet book "Concentration Camps in the Soviet Union Run by Jews" (1937), which was subsequently reprinted several times under the title "Slave Labor in the USSR"[1]. On September 11, 1938, he joined the SS (number 997 868) as an Untersturmführer, by the end of his life he had the rank of Obersturmbannführer."""

Here the death of millions could not be accounted for as murder and moreover, these death-sacrificed victims of Jewish tyranny could be exploited to the last drop of blood in the interest of a. "Socialistic State" before being freed by the merciful reaper-death.""" """In spite of the ever increasing masses of prisoners this "living material" very often is not sufficient to fulfill the fantastic "plans" of the government, because people die as a result of the horrible conditions that prevail in these concentration camps about as rapidly as new material can be delivered. And so, the Soviet government organizes and conducts from time to time "man-hunts" to provide new material. People are often arrested and exiled who even in the eyes of the government could not be in any sense regarded as "undesirables"."""

the "Senate Committee" results are literally just some insane dude's rambling -- he claims most Bolshevik leaders were Jews from Brooklyn, New York: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-5b1CpjAcQ&list=PLNGRQi2kyMcIARUW8gw3ZNm8H62lmcIF8&index=22> <https://archive.org/stream/cu31924030480051/cu31924030480051_djvu.txt> """The latest startling information, given me by some one who says that there is good authority for it — and I ani to be given the exact figures later on and have them checked up properly by the proper authorities — is this, that in December, 1918. in the northern community of Petrograd, so-called — that is what they call that section of the Soviet regime under the presidency of the man known as Mr. Apfelbaum — out of 388 members, only 16 happened to be real Russians, and all the rest Jews, with the exception possibly of one man, who is a negro from America, who calls himself Prof. Gordon, and 265 of the members of this northern commune govern- ment, that is sitting in the old Smolny Institute, came from the lower East Side of New York — 265 of them. If that is true, and they are going to check it up for me — certain Eussians in New York who have been there and investigated the facts — I think that that fits into what you are driving at. In fact, I am very much impressed with this, that moving around here I find that certain Bolsheviki propagandists are nearly all Jews — apostate Jews. I have been in the so-called People's House, at 7 East Fifteenth Street, New York, which calls itself also the Rand School of Social Science, and I have visited that at least six times during the last eleven weeks or so, buying their literature, and some of the most seditious stuff I have ever found against our own Government, and 19 out of every 20 people I have seen there have been Jews."""

# judeo-bolshevism: who killed the tsar / czar (common neo-Nazi talking point)
#####o
list of people who killed the Czar: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_of_the_Romanov_family#Executioners> Ivan Plotnikov, history professor at the Maksim Gorky Ural State University, has established that the executioners were **Yakov Yurovsky**, **Grigory P. Nikulin**, **Mikhail A. Medvedev (Kudrin)**, **Peter Ermakov**, **Stepan Vaganov**, **Alexey G. Kabanov** (former soldier in the tsar's Life Guards and Chekist assigned to the attic machine gun),[48] **Pavel Medvedev**, **V. N. Netrebin**, and **Y. M. Tselms**. Filipp Goloshchyokin, a close associate of Yakov Sverdlov, being a military commissar of the Uralispolkom in Yekaterinburg, however did not actually participate, and two or three guards refused to take part.
Yakov Mikhailovich Yurovsky: raised Jewish, converted Lutheran <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakov_Yurovsky> Yakov Mikhailovich Yurovsky was the eighth of ten children born to Mikhail Yurovsky, a glazier, and his wife Ester Moiseevna (1848–1919), a seamstress. He was born on 19 June [O.S. 7 June] 1878 in the Siberian city of Tomsk, Russia. The Yurovsky family were Jewish. The historian Helen Rappaport writes that the young Yurovsky studied the Talmud in his early youth, while the family seems to have later attempted to distance themselves from their Jewish roots; this may have been prompted by the prejudice toward Jews frequently exhibited in Russia at the time.[1] Shortly before fully devoting himself to the cause of revolution, in the early twentieth century Yurovsky converted to Lutheranism.[1]
Grigory Petrovich Nikulin: raised in a parish school: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigory_Petrovich_Nikulin> Nikulin was born and raised in Zvenigorodka, Kiev province, Russian Empire. He came from a lower-class family. His father Pyotr Iossiffovich (Пётр Иосифович) was a bricklayer and mother Anna Ivanovna a housewife. At the age of 9 Grigory started attending parish school at Zvenigorod church, which he enjoyed immensely. Education was interrupted by his family's disastrous financial situation. After which he started working in a local blacksmith shop. In the spring of 1909 family sold their house in Zvenigorodka and moved to a nearby small town of Uman. At the age of 16 Grigory moved out of parent's house and became a bricklayer. He joined a local social democratic club in Uman in 1913. Soon he was deported from Kiev province and moved to Kazan.
Mikhail Aleksandrovich Medvedev-Kudrin: raised in a parish school: <https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9C%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%B2,_%D0%9C%D0%B8%D1%85%D0%B0%D0%B8%D0%BB_%D0%90%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87> В 1900 году закончил церковно-приходскую школу в селе Изгар, в 1900—1908 годах жил в Чистополе, где начал учиться в школе ремесленных учеников, но после второго класса был вынужден бросить учёбу из-за тяжёлого материального положения семьи[1]. [In 1900 he graduated from a parish school in the village of Izgar. In 1900-1908 he lived in Chistopol, where he began to study at a school of artisanal students, but after the second grade he was forced to drop out of school due to the difficult financial situation of his family.[1]]
Pyotr Zakharovich Ermakov: raised in a parish school: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Ermakov> Pyotr Zakharovich Ermakov was born on 13 December [O.S. 1 December] 1884, and raised in and around the Verkh-Isetskiy workhouse in Yekaterinburg, Russian Empire. Ermakov graduated from the local parish school, working thereafter as a metal craftsman, and between 1909 and 1912, is listed as living in Vologodskaya Province.

Squicciarini (2020) documented that French areas that were more religious in the late 19th century were less likely to introduce new technical curriculum in schools, thus forgoing skills essential for experiencing the second industrial revolution in France
^ todo reread xxx: 

For instance, the emphasis on tradition in most religions may discourage certain behaviors such as innovation and creativity, which are otherwise beneficial to economic growth (B´enabou et al., forthc). B´enabou, Ticchi, and Vindigni illustrate the potential contesting between the worldviews of science and religion in a theoretical model, where the recurrent arrival of scientific discoveries generate productivity gains, but at the same time threaten to erode religious beliefs by contradicting aspects of religious doctrines. As a result, religious elites have incentives to curb the development of science and new ideas. Examples abound of such conflicts, from the trial of Galilei in 1633 to President George W. Bush’s restrictions on federal funding for embryonic stem-cell research. In support of the model, Benabou, Ticchi, and Vindigni uncover that contemporary countries or US states that are more religious have fewer patents per capita. An alternative model may explain the same tendency with substitution between religion and science; if intellectual resources can be used for either religious or scientific studies, religiously interested individuals may be more inclined to engage in religious studies, thus crowding out the study of science. The proposition is not that religion and science cannot go hand-in-hand. Indeed, there are several examples of great contributors to science who were deeply religious - perhaps most famously Sir Isaac Newton (1642-1727). Also, some of Europe’s largest universities - Bologna and Oxford for instance - were established by monasteries. Thus, it remains a matter of empirical testing whether religion and science contested or complemented one another.

Along the same lines, Cantoni & Yuchtman (2013) argue that the introduction of a new, productive form of human capital, such as the emergence of modern science, depends on whether the government or church see the new knowledge as threatening to their position of power. The authors argue that Islamic elites who controlled educational institutions in the Middle Ages initially promoted the study of logic and science, because the gains from spreading these skills (more converts to Islam) outweighed the costs (potential criticism of the religious elites). This period of elite support for scientific study saw the flourishing of Islamic society. However, as Islam took over in the Middle East, the gains to elites from the study of logic and science declined. Elites started to oppress the study of science, and the Muslim world fell behind. Chaney (2016) provides econometric support for these ideas. He links the decline in scientific and technological production in the Muslim world in the late Medieval period to the extensive spread of madrasas, educational centers where Islamic law was taught. Using data on book production during the period 800-1800, Chaney documents a sharply rising trend in the proportion of religious books written, accompanied by a drop in original and scientific-technical books. With our data, we can test empirically whether something similar occurred within Europe.

Over the past 10 years, research on this question has produced mixed results. Some studies have reported that rates of suicide attempt and suicidal ideation are lower among persons who have a religious affiliation (Carli et al., 2014; Dervic et al., 2004; Dervic et al., 2011; Kralovec et al., 2014; Kukoyi et al., 2010; Spencer et al., 2012), those who attend religious services more frequently (Blackmore et al., 2008; Caribe et al., 2012; Hoffman and Marsiglia, 2014; Kaslow et al., 2004; Langille et al., 2012; Nkansah-Amankra et al., 2012; Rasic et al., 2009; Rasic et al., 2011a; Rasic et al., 2011b; Robins and Fiske, 2009; Robinson et al., 2012; Rushing et al., 2013; Sisask et al., 2010; Taliaferro et al., 2009; Taylor et al., 2011), and those who say religion is important in their lives (Albert et al., 2005; Rasic et al., 2011a). However, these findings exist alongside a large number of studies finding no relationship between religion and suicide risk (Birkholz et al., 2004; Chatters et al., 2011; Hamdan et al., 2012; Huguelet et al., 2007; Le et al., 2012; Nonnemaker et al., 2003; Stroppa and Moreira-Almeida, 2013; Tran Thi Thanh et al., 2006; Young et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2006) and a few studies suggesting religious characteristics can sometimes be a risk factor (Mihaljevic et al., 2012; Stratta et al., 2012; Xie et al., 2012; Zhang and Xu, 2007; Zhao et al., 2012). Importantly, most of these studies did not assess clinical samples, and only 4 explicitly enrolled persons with mood disorders (Dervic et al., 2004; Dervic et al., 2011; Rushing et al., 2013; Stroppa and Moreira-Almeida, 2013) This leaves unanswered questions not only about the relationship between religion and suicide risk, but also more specifically about that relationship for adults with depression."""

The earth shook, the rocks split 52 and the tombs broke open. The bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life. 53 They came out of the tombs after Jesus’ resurrection and[a] went into the holy city and appeared to many people. 54 When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified, and exclaimed, “Surely he was the Son of God!”

early christians were communalists: <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ecaf.12211> The notion that indigence might generate a legitimate claim to succour never entered into a donor’s deliberations: poor relief, a core purpose of welfare, never evolved in Roman philanthropy. [....] Christians adopted approaches to welfare that were new to Roman eyes. The very first community of Christians, in first-century Jerusalem, hosted free communal meals; deacons were appointed to oversee distribution of the common fund that had been endowed by wealthy members of the congregation though property sales (Acts 4–6). [....] Tertullian bracketed his community’s income, deposita pietatis, with corresponding spending on beneficiaries, alumni confessionis. [....] Christianity was on the pathway to a model of society where, according to Andrea Giardina (2007, p. 768), ‘poverty assumed a central position, in the collective imagination as in the redistribution of wealth’. [....] Ambrose was an unbending defender of property rights, in particular of the right of the church to own property, quite logically so because such rights were a prerequisite for dispensing benevolentia. [....] Sermons such as these had practical implications for welfare provision. Lists of paupers eligible for support were compiled, called matricula; according to John Chrysostomos, in Antioch the number came to 3,000 (John Chrysostomos 1888, pp. 706–7).

(By way of comparison, 73% of the whole adult public (and 67% of Christians) said that it should be legal in the control group survey with a representative sample from the same poll. But although Muslims’ views are now out of line with the more liberal views of the British public as a whole, it should perhaps be borne in mind that as recently as 1993 the British Social Attitudes survey found 50% of the adult British public believing that “sexual relations between two adults of the same sex” were “always wrong”.) **Young Muslims are significantly more likely to agree that homosexuality should be legal (28% of 18-24 year olds, 23% of 25-34 year olds),** but even in these age groups there was a clear plurality against: as many 18-24 year olds strongly disagree as agree, strongly or otherwise, and among 25-34 year olds almost twice as many do so."""

# evidence for no effect
among 451 trauma survivors, trigger warnings did not reduce (self-reported) vulnerability or anxiety (even for people who thought that words can harm or for people with PTSD): <https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2167702620921341> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1177/2167702620921341> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/725697048946671687/unknown.png

In standardized terms, the effects for this subset were: rating of material: dUnbiased = 0.00, 95% CI = [–0.40, 0.40]; negative affect: dUnbiased = –0.26, 95% CI = [–0.57, 0.05]; intrusion tally: dUnbiased = –0.02, 95% CI = [–0.61, 0.57]; IES intrusions: dUnbiased = –0.10, 95% CI = [–0.54, 0.34]; comprehension: dUnbiased = –0.17, 95% CI = [–0.74, 0.39]; avoidance: dUnbiased = 0.04, 95% CI = [–0.68, 0.76]).

# evidence for negative effect
among those without experience of PTSD, trigger warnings significantly increase anxiety among those who believe that words can harm people: <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005791618301137> <http://sci-hub.se/10.1016/j.jbtep.2018.07.002> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/636098824443658242/unknown.png Participants were recruited on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk[.] [....] A single-item screening question excluded individuals who had experienced a canonical stressor (e.g., rape, natural disaster) qualifying for Criterion A of the PTSD diagnosis in DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Three hundred participants completed the study. Four participants were excluded from all analyses because they reported having received a diagnosis of PTSD despite denying exposure to canonical traumatic stressors. [....] A simple slopes analysis indicated that for participants who do not have a strong belief that words can cause harm (MWCHS – 1 SD), receiving a trigger warning does not significantly increase anxiety from baseline (B = -4.57, t(265) = -1.73, ns). However, if participants have a strong belief that words can harm (MWCHS + 1 SD), trigger warnings significantly increase anxiety from baseline (B = 5.90, t(265) = 2.20, p < .05).
among those who believe trigger warnings are protecting against anxiety, trigger warnings significantly increase negative affect : <https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/beautiful-minds/are-trigger-warnings-actually-helpful/> <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002210311830060X> <http://sci-hub.se/10.1016/j.jesp.2018.08.006> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/636102465594458122/unknown.png We recruited 120 individuals from across the United States through Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk), but an additional 28 additional participants signed up despite not finishing the survey. Of these 148 individuals, 4 were excluded on account of English being their second language and 64 participants dropped out of the survey after informed consent but prior to answering any questions, resulting in a final sample of 80 participants. [....] There was, however, a significant warning × beliefs interaction (F(2, 702) = 4.54, p = .01, partial η2 = 0.013) (See Fig. 5). Simple effects reveal that those who believed trigger warnings to be coddling (one standard deviation below the mean) experienced more negative affect in the control condition compared to both the Trigger Warning Only condition (Mdifference= 4.69, 95% CI [1.74 7.65], p = .002, d = 0.30) and the Trigger Warning with Content condition (Mdifference= 4.15, 95% CI [1.45, 6.85], p = .003, d = 0.28).

# background: us subsidized media extensively
CJR 2010: uniquely among governments of the time, the US government recognized that the market wouldn't underfund investigative media, so they subsidized media to the tune of $30 billion (0.2% of GDP): <https://archives.cjr.org/the_news_frontier/rejuvenating_american_journali.php> <https://archive.ph/I0FMs> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/868276307404935208/unknown.png """There was no notion that “the market,” unsubsidized, would produce sufficient journalism; the idea was unthinkable until the late 19th or early 20th century, when, with the striking explosion in advertising, commercial interests began to prosper. To that end, in the first generations of our nation’s history the federal government instituted extraordinarily large postal and printing subsidies with the explicit goal of broadening and deepening the amount of newspapers and periodical in the United States. These were brilliant subsidies that did not favor a single party or viewpoint; indeed, they made much of the abolitionist press possible while also supporting pro-slavery publications. If the United States federal government devoted the same percentage of GDP to subsidizing journalism today that it did in the 1840s, for example, the expenditure would be around $30 billion. Indeed the one area that distinguished the American government from European governments at the time was its commitment to creating a huge and credible democratic press system."""

# cjr's citizenship news voucher
CJR 2010: explaining the "Citizenship News Voucher" concept: $200/yr voucher to nonprofit media as defined broadly by the IRS: <https://archives.cjr.org/the_news_frontier/rejuvenating_american_journali.php> <https://archive.ph/I0FMs> """The idea is simple: every American adult gets a $200 voucher she can use to donate government money to any nonprofit news medium of her choice. She will indicate her choice on her tax return. If she does not file a tax return, a simple form will be available to use. She can split her $200 among several different qualifying nonprofit media. This program would be purely voluntary, like the tax-form check-offs for funding elections or protecting wildlife. A government agency, possibly operating out of the Internal Revenue Service, can be set up to allocate the funds and to determine eligibility—according to universal standards that err on the side of expanding rather than constraining the number of qualifying media."""

# baker's artistic freedom voucher
Baker 2003: explains the program artistic freedom voucher (AFV): <https://www.policyarchive.org/handle/10207/20794> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/853444815344369664/baker2003.pdf> """The AFV would allow each individual to contribute a refundable tax credit of approximately $100 to a creative worker of their choice, or to an intermediary who passes funds along to creative workers. Recipients of the AFV (creative workers and intermediaries) would be required to register with the government in the same way that religious or charitable organizations must now register for tax-exempt status. This registration is only for the purpose of preventing fraud – it does not involve any evaluation of the quality of the work being produced."""

Copyrights and the AFV are alternative ways in which the government supports creative workers. Creative workers are entitled to be compensated once for their work, not twice. The AFV would not affect a creative workers ability to receive money for concerts or other live performances. [....] A $100 per adult voucher would be sufficient to pay 500,000 writers, musicians, singers, actors, or other creative workers $40,000 a year. All of the material produced by these workers would be placed in the public domain where it could be freely reproduced."""

[....] Under plausible assumptions, the savings from reduced expenditures on copyrighted material would vastly exceed the cost of the AFV. [....] The AFV would immediately create a pool of money (approximately $20 billion annually) to support creative and artistic workers that is far larger than the amount that currently flows to them through copyright-protected material. [...] [T]he current distribution of royalties and related payments is heavily concentrated among a small group of singers, actors, writers and other creative workers[.] [...] This means that almost all creative workers would stand to earn far more through the AFV system than through the copyright system. [....] The projections assume much more modest savings (20 percent in the high savings scenario and 10 percent in the low savings scenario) in the case of books, advertising, and cable and pay TV. In these cases, a much higher proportion of the costs are attributable to the physical production and distribution of the material, rather than the compensation of the creative workers."""

right-wing users exist within a right-wing media echochamber where the furthest-right news is rewarded and center-right news is shunned: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUrGA48clA4> <http://fdslive.oup.com/www.oup.com/academic/pdf/openaccess/9780190923624.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/536269210389577740/unknown.png The particular prominence of the right-most column in Figure 2.7 reflects the overwhelming prominence of Breitbart, as also reflected in the network maps. [...] On Twitter, the center-right is the least represented. On Facebook, both the center and center-right garnered relatively little attention. This pattern suggests that social media sharing in general is more partisan than hyperlinking, and sharing on Facebook is more partisan than on Twitter.
right-wing users exist within a right-wing media echochamber where Breitbart and Fox dominate: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUrGA48clA4> <http://fdslive.oup.com/www.oup.com/academic/pdf/openaccess/9780190923624.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/536272411893563423/unknown.png While the prominence of individual media sources in the right-wing sphere varies when assessed by shares on Facebook and Twitter, the content and core structure, with Breitbart at the center, is stable across platforms. Even in the highly charged pre-election months, everyone outside the Breitbart-centered universe formed a tightly interconnected attention network, with major traditional mass-media and professional sources at the core. The right, by contrast, formed its own insular sphere centered on Breitbart. [....] Outside the rightwing ecosystem, we did not see a leftward polarization but its opposite—an increase in the authority of, and attention paid to, the traditional professional media that occupy the center and center-left, at the expense of the left. On the right, the most important shift was that Fox News reasserted its authority as the central node of the online right-wing media ecosystem. This revival came at the expense of Breitbart, which declined to second place online (leaving aside Fox dominance of conservative television throughout the election and post-election periods). However, Fox News’s resurgence did not increase connections between the right and the rest of the network. During the election, Fox online received 40 percent of its inlinks from the right quintile. In the year after the election, Fox received 51 percent of its links from the right quintile. This shift reflected a decline in linking to Fox across-the-board, not only from the left. Indeed, links from the center-right and the center to Fox declined proportionately more than did links from the center-left and left.8

# political views don't change over time
your political views are three times more malleable in your teens than in your midlife: <https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/07/08/upshot/how-the-year-you-were-born-influences-your-politics.html> <http://archive.is/0S3vo> <http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/cohort_voting_20140605.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/473938047046778880/unknown.png
political views solidify in your teens: <http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/07/09/the-politics-of-american-generations-how-age-affects-attitudes-and-voting-behavior/> <https://books.google.com/books?id=3a927Jder6IC#v=onepage> On an individual level, of course, many people’s political views evolve over the course of their lives. But academic research indicates not only that generations have distinct political identities, but that most people’s basic  outlooks and orientations are set fairly early on in life. As one famous longitudinal study of Bennington College women put it, “through late childhood and early adolescence, attitudes are relatively malleable…with the potential for dramatic change possible in late adolescence or early adulthood. [B]ut greater stability sets in at some early point, and attitudes tend to be increasingly persistent as people age.” [unformatted redo]

# political views change over time
brits become more conservative as they age, but it's not associated with most significant life events: <https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/03/do-we-become-more-conservative-with-age-young-old-politics> <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261379413000875> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1016/j.electstud.2013.06.007> Ageing makes people more likely to vote Conservative. The question of whether future Conservative support is threatened by generational replacement can therefore be answered with some confidence in the negative. Newer generations are not less Conservative than older generations once ageing effects are controlled for using side information taken from the panel studies. There are nonetheless identifiable political generations. Individuals born in certain years appear more or less Conservative, ignoring trend effects, depending on the prevailing political conditions at the time that they entered the electorate. [....] Given the increasing longevity of the electorate and the increased proportion who are elderly, our findings indicate that over time we should expect to see an increasingly Conservative electorate. [....] The elderly are not Conservative because they are rich, but because they are elderly. [....] While we can rule out some social ageing effects (due to marriage, income changes and so forth), we do not know exactly why people become more supportive of the right as they age.

Kalla and Broockman 2016: deep canvassing (having a ~10 minute conversation encouraging the person to consider a trans person's perspective) increased tolerance of transgender people (~.3 SD) and support for a gender nondiscrimination law (~.5 points on -3 to +3 scale); these effects persisted and strengthened after 3 months, and were robust to a fake negative ad against the law: <https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/10/magazine/how-do-you-change-voters-minds-have-a-conversation.html> <http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6282/220> <http://sci-hub.st/10.1126/science.aad9713> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/801830550729129984/broockman2016.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/801832782732984350/unknown.png Defining “transgender” in the item wording revealed that placebo subjects were less supportive of protecting this group (P < 0.05, one-tailed).

A hefty pile of studies (419 at last count) measures the price elasticity of demand for animal foods—that is, the relationship between prices and consumption. In 2010, a meta-study determined that a 1 percent change in the price of beef causes American consumption to change by about 0.75 percent. 33 In other words, notwithstanding all the other reasons why people buy beef—including marketing, taste, and nutritional beliefs—a 10 percent price change will shift consumption by about 7.5 percent. The study found that dairy has demand elasticity of 0.65, meaning that a 10 percent price change in dairy products causes consumption to change by about 6.5 percent. 34

Berners-Lee et al. (2012) estimated that vegans save 14% on their grocery store purchases relative to meat eaters, but that estimate is not based on individual data, but an amalgamation of several datasets and various assumptions about how UK eating habits mimic those of the US. The Berners-Lee study separated vegetarians for vegans, and found that, of the two, vegans spent more on money.
Only one study (to our knowledge) has analyzed food expenditures at the individual level for those who are and are not vegetarians. Using a survey of 1600 Canadians, data were collected on vegetarian status (lacto-ovo vegetarians, to be specific) and self-reported monthly food expenditures. Results showed that, contrary to previous studies, vegetarians actually spent more money on food (Guillemette and Cranfield, 2012). [xxx todo reread]

Overall, we estimate the economic benefits of improving diets to be 1–31 trillion US dollars, which is equivalent to 0.4–13% of global gross domestic product (GDP) in 2050.

* this study assumes that more doctor visits leads to more healthcare expenditures -- it's not clear that this is true (eg, Japan has 12 visits/yr vs USA 4 visits/yr, Japan 2x cheaper than USA), so the economic impact assumptions appear invalid
in Germany, if one assumes that national health expenditures (NHE) and doctor visits are 1:1, then a 1% decrease in pet ownership was estimated to increase NHE by +0.262 billion EUR/yr (in 2000: 1.09 USD/EUR, 282m Americans/82m Germans => `.262*1.09*(282/82)` = +0.982 billion USD/yr); the elimination of pet ownership was estimated to increase NHE by 5.59 billion EUR/yr (in 2000: `5.59*1.09*(282/82)` = +21.0 billion USD/yr): <https://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=674270738133649;res=IELBUS> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/683330236359770121/pet_ownership.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/683321432167546897/unknown.png """Simple multiplication shows that if the 21.3% of the population who ‘always’ owned a pet in Germany went to the doctor 1.12 times a year more often, and the PetNow and Pet5ago groups also went as often as the PetNever group, then the total increase in doctor visits nation-wide would be 2.56%. Health expenditure (2000) was 218.4 billion Euros. So loss of all pets would bring in its train an increase in national health expenditure of 5.59 billion Euros (0.0256 x 218.4 billion Euros). Another way of viewing the issue is to say that every 1% fall in pet ownership in the PetAlways group results in extra health costs of about 262 million Euros per year. So the actual fall in ownership of 1.4% which occurred between 1996 and 2001 probably cost about 367 million Euros.6"""
in Australia, if one assumes that national health expenditures (NHE) and doctor visits are 1:1, then a 1% decrease in pet ownership was estimated to increase NHE by `.495/7.3` = +0.0678 billion AUD/yr (in 2000: 1.34 USD/AUD, 282 Americans/19m Australians => `.0678*1.34*(282/19)` = +1.35 billion USD/yr); the elimination of pet ownership was estimated to increase NHE by 3.86 billion (in 2000: `3.86*1.34*(282/19)` = +76.8 billion USD/yr): <https://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=674270738133649;res=IELBUS> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/683330236359770121/pet_ownership.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/683330385400168464/unknown.png """In Australia far more people own pets, so the imputed losses are proportionately larger. If the 56.9% of Australians who ‘always’ owned a pet went to the doctor as often as non-owners (i.e. 0.57 times a year more than they do now), and if adjustments are also made for the PetNow and Pet5ago groups, then the national increase in doctor visits and in resulting health expenditure would be 7.19%. Given that national health expenditure in 1999-2000 was $53.7 billion, this would represent an expenditure increase of $3.86 billion. Or, to put it another way, the decline in pet ownership of 7.3% which the ISSS-A estimates to have occurred between 1996 and 2001 may have cost about $495 million in increased health expenditure. About $351 million (71%) of this would have been borne by governments and about $144 million (29%) would have been privately incurred health expenditure."""

Park 2019: normative realism from NMA: current scientific theories perform better than chance, ergo scientific theories are warranted: <http://www.klemens.sav.sk/fiusav/filozofia/?q=en/filozofia.2019.74.4.2> <https://sci-hub.se/10.31577/filozofia.2019.74.4.2> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/803705298233458688/park2019.pdf> By contrast, normative realism, because it is a normative thesis, is not capable of being true or false. Even if T [a strong, current scientific theory] happens to be true, it is an open question whether it is warranted or not, as will become clear in the next section.
Park 2019: descriptive pessimism from NMA: past scientific theories were false, ergo present scientific theories are false: <http://www.klemens.sav.sk/fiusav/filozofia/?q=en/filozofia.2019.74.4.2> <https://sci-hub.se/10.31577/filozofia.2019.74.4.2> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/803705298233458688/park2019.pdf> The descriptive PI holds that just as T1 [a past scientific theory] was false, so T2 [a current scientific theory] is false, where the former is a past theory and the latter is a present theory. This version of the PI can be inferred from Putnam’s formulation of the PI that “Just as no term used in the science of more than fifty (or whatever) years ago referred, so it will turn out that no term used now (except maybe observational terms, if there are such) refers” (1978: 25). The descriptive PI can also be inferred from Stathis Psillos’s formulation of the PI that “if most past successful scientific theories turned out to be false, then, by induction on scientific theories, one must not just remain agnostic, but rather claim that current successful scientific theories are likely to be false” (1995: 16). Keep in mind that the descriptive PI asserts that T2 is false.

The normative PI is neutral about the truth-value of T2. It says that T2 might be true, and that even though T2 is true, we cannot justifiably believe that it is true. No one has directly formulated the PI in this manner in the literature. It, however, can be inferred from James Ladyman’s formulation that “reflection on the abandonment of theories in the history of science motivates the expectation that our best current scientific theories will themselves be abandoned, and hence that we ought not to assent to them” (Ladyman, 2014). To say that we ought not to assent to present theories is to say that T2 is unwarranted.

So they think that it is better to be ontologically parsimonious and not posit it in the first place.

# determinism: quantum is truly random
quantum mechanics is genuinely random -- it does not appear possible to interpret it as deterministic: <https://philosophy.stackexchange.com/questions/1210/in-which-way-does-quantum-mechanics-disprove-determinism> Most researchers on the foundations of quantum mechanics, however, usually side-step this question by taking the operationalist point of view. Tagline: "all we have is some procedures for setting up an experiment and the results of experiments". In this framework, you can derive Bell's theorem, which says that any phenomenon that is both deterministic and local must satisfy the Bell inequality. Quantum mechanics violates the Bell inequality (and there have been many experiments that mostly confirm this violation, there are some technical loopholes that need to be addressed in some of the experiments). This means that you must give up at least one: locality or determinism. Since without locality it becomes impossible to talk about causality, most people prefer not to give it up, and instead give up determinism.

# basic research results
basic researhc may result in enormous (and unforseen) breakthroughs: <http://abt.ucpress.edu/content/72/5/38> First, show the class a photograph of a cancer cell labeled "GFP." [...] Briefly mention the leaps in understanding of cancer cell growth and cell division that GFP has made possible. Introduce the students to [...] Osamu Shimomura, who [...] was hired to simply investigate why a dried jellyfish glowed green when crushed. The resulting manuscript describing GFP gives no hint to the future implications of this protein (Shimomura et al., 1957), a discovery for which he would eventually share the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2008. Finally, [...] [m]ention the importance of sequencing in understanding the evolution of HIV. [...] [I]ntroduce them to a profile of John Trela, Alice Chien, and David Edgar, who discovered Taq polymerase during basic research investigations. This discovery has earned billions of dollars in royalties (Fore et al., 2006) yet was the unintentional result of a basic research investigation into life at high temperatures (Chien et al., 1976).
basic research often results in major breakthroughs (): <https://www.aaas.org/news/report-basic-science-research-critical-us-well-being> "Basic research is often misunderstood, because it often seems to have no immediate payoff," the MIT report says. "Yet it was just such federally funded research into the fundamental working of cells, intensified beginning with the 'War on Cancer' in 1971, that led over time to a growing arsenal of sophisticated new anticancer therapies — 19 new drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the past two years." It adds, "Do we want similar progress on Alzheimer's, which already affects five million Americans, more than any single form of cancer? Then we should expand research in neurobiology, brain chemistry and the science of aging."

# decline

# riskier, government better
government is better at handling basic science because it is too risky for private businesses: <http://science.sciencemag.org/content/336/6080/392> For business management it is risky, and given the long time periods required for practical benefit, not sufficiently profitable, for most companies to finance such curiosity-driven fundamental research. Instead, this basic scientific research must be adequately funded by governments, both to produce the skilled problem-solvers needed by the private sector and because the research results themselves deliver substantial benefits to the local economy.

Subsequently, Bryden and I collaborated with Taha Amir in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Yokahida Ida in Japan, and we also put together larger Western samples (mainly Canada and the UK), and Indian samples. Of 17 850, 14 924, 4485, and 656 offspring in the West, UAE, India, and Japan, for whom p(L) was 11.5%, 7.5%, 5.8%, and 4.0% respectively, the odds ratios for the effect of having a left-handed parent were 2.11×, 2.23×, 3.18× and 3.57× respectively, which is the pattern expected from gene frequency differences. Geographical differences in the modern world seem therefore to be primarily genetic in origin, rather than due to differences in social pressure (or what I will refer to subsequently as “direct social pressure”)."""

John A. Ball, Director of the White Fathers Information Center, in the following communication addressed to the New York Times in January 1961: The American press has repeatedly stated that there are only sixteen college graduates among the Congo's population of 14,000,000. This is simply not true. The 417 native Congolese Catholic priests should certainly be considered as "college graduates" since they have followed the same course of study as is offered in any Catholic seminary. Furthermore, I am personally acquainted with several who have doctorate degrees from recognized universities. Actually, there are over 4,000 Congolese who have the equivalent of an American college education. The nowfamous "sixteen" are men who have university degrees corresponding to post-graduate studies in the United States.'4 It must be emphasized, however, that the figure of 4,000 college-educated Congolese is obviously cumulative. It nevertheless presents an order of magnitude that is at variance with the magical figure of "sixteen college graduates" that no doubt will be foreveremembered asthe sum total of Belgium's educational efforts in the center of Africa. In actual fact, even that figure was inaccurate by July 1960, for another fourteen graduates joined the 1959 class to form a total of thirty such graduates - equivalent to American graduate degrees."""

This felt different from their experience on the left. “Opinionated, educated liberals,” they write, “often have no idea what happens in state legislatures, local government boards, or political party committees. Grassroots Tea Partiers, by contrast, know the rules and procedures for passing bills and advancing regulations in detail—for local, state, and national government.” 23 Tea Party groups were often short-lived local organizations that withered away by the end of the Obama era. For some activists, participation was surely motivated more by short-term hobbyism, news obsession, and conspiracy theories than by a commitment to long-term power.

While nonwhite Americans, particularly those in the middle and upper classes, can engage in political hobbyism as much as anyone else, research on racial politics suggests some important differences in minority communities that should limit the phenomenon. Namely, no matter how economically or professionally successful, black voters tend to see their own fate, and the fate of their families, as tied to the fate of the racial group as a whole. To a lesser extent this pattern is visible among Latinos as well. 8 The idea of linked fate may be the best explanation for why racial minorities, blacks especially, tend to be unified politically even though they exhibit internal diversity in wealth or religiosity or other traits that are predictive of political divisions among whites. Linked fate also rationalizes political action as a form of self-preservation and self-interest. Supporting the group, empowering the group, also helps empower oneself and one’s family."""

If folks start these groups within the structure of the Democratic Party, they get resources from the party that they couldn’t otherwise get, such as access to the national Democrats’ voter database and computer system, which the state party pays for and shares with its local affiliates. Plus, a sustained organization gives volunteers time to meet neighbors and form deeper relationships with voters than they otherwise could do from one-off volunteering.

Angela comes back to those memories of Wisconsin rallies. “You need to have conversations with people who aren’t already convinced. At rallies, you might think you’re drawing attention, but your snarky signs aren’t going to persuade anyone.” But in an area where liberals were in hiding, lonely at home and in church, demonstrations served the specific purpose of recruitment. Angela and her team would stand in that plaza next to the court, her kids in a carrier and in a stroller, and new allies would approach them, just like how the first small group found Angela in the same plaza.

Angela has driven undocumented immigrants in her VOW community to doctors’ appointments. Some are too afraid of being deported if they get pulled over that they won’t drive at all, even to the doctor’s. One woman in the community was about to be evicted from her home, and the group quickly came to her assistance. When the federal government shut down in 2019, the group chipped in for gas cards and diapers to help those not making ends meet. All quietly and behind the scenes. “This is the most powerful thing I’ve ever done,” Angela says about creating VOW. “It’s the thing I feel called to do.”

In Egypt, for instance, protests in Cairo’s Tahrir Square spurred elections, which was a major victory—after a mere eighteen days of protest, the country’s leader of almost thirty years stepped down. But the secular movement in Tahrir Square had no leaders, no ability to organize, and no capacity to mobilize voters. The liberal energy that spurred change lost the elections to an organized party, the right-wing Muslim Brotherhood, which was eventually forced out of power by a military coup. Activists with an Internet connection could crumble a government but could not build one in its place. 9 To do that, you need a hierarchy of leaders from low-level people willing to knock on thirty-five doors to middle-level organizers to higher-level leaders with a plan.

And to the surprise of reformers, most voters didn’t take any interest in primaries. They would vote in general elections but didn’t care to weigh in on the party nominations. 17 That’s true even today; only a fraction of general-election voters participate in primaries for state and local offices. Critics of primaries were also uneasy that high-profile candidates who hadn’t proven themselves as stewards of a party’s values could swoop in and dominate.

Does this mean they were right after all? Well, no. This type of analysis shows broad similarities in populations: it reflects geographical landmasses, which are not insurmountable barriers to reproduction, but do hinder interbreeding; it also reflects evolutionary history and migration. The data also showed long, clear gradients between all of the clusters, and no unambiguous way to say where one cluster ends and another begins. Without sharp boundaries between these population structures, instead it showed continuity between people. This, as Johann Gottfried von Herder had suggested, was because human variation will not succumb to an imposed artificial taxonomy, but instead reflects history. Rosenberg’s paper is often used by racists to erroneously claim that there are indeed five genetically distinct races. In fact, it does no such thing, and this is obvious in the data: when the clusters are set at two, Africa, Europe and West Asia are lumped together as one and the rest of the world as another. There is no a priori reason to settle on five clusters as being the definitive categorisation of humans, and deciding to do so because it corresponds with an earlier yet debunked classification is simply affirming pre-existing biases. When you increase the cluster number to six, the next distinct group to emerge are the Kalasha. They are a northern Pakistani tribe of around 4,000 people who marry almost exclusively within their own ethnic population, which is tucked away in relative isolation in the mountains of the Hindu Kush.

This type of analysis is totally valid, and is the basis for studying human history, migration and genetic variation between populations and people. We could keep increasing the number of clusters and find ever more precise similarities and overlaps. When even higher resolution genetic mapping was applied to the people of Britain in 2015, families who had lived in Devon for multiple generations could be distinguished from the people of Cornwall, and when these precise differences were plotted on a map the boundary was the River Tamar, which for centuries has effectively been the county line. When the same technique was applied to the Iberian Peninsula in 2019, it showed vertical stripes of similarity, revealing that Spain’s history meant that people are fractionally but measurably more similar in a north–south axis than they are east to west. Are they functionally different? Of course not, it’s simply that we have become so good at identifying the genetic histories of populations that we can pick up these wispy, diaphanous traces of similarity and difference.

But the process of genetic shuffling that occurs in the formation of sperm and egg guarantees that each one of those two cells is unique and carries a unique half genome (therefore a unique half is lost in subsequent generations, should that sperm or egg be successful). Which means that not the same half gets transferred each generation. Over the generations, descendants begin to shed the DNA of their actual ancestors. The amount that vanishes is cumulatively huge: you carry DNA from only half of your ancestors eleven generations back. Genealogy and genetic genealogy are not perfectly matched, and progressively grow apart as we go back in time. It is therefore possible that you are genetically unrelated to people from whom you are actually descended as recently as the middle of the eighteenth century.

Pigmentation, specific diets, resistance to diseases (such as malaria) and other traits are demonstrably local adaptations that are part of humankind’s success in colonising the world. Adaptationism is an error because in many cases it results in untestable hypotheses, but ones that are appealing because they sound superficially convincing – blacks are good sprinters because of selection during slavery; Jews are intellectually gifted because their history of persecution enriched genes associated with brains."""

For really complex human traits, where thousands of minuscule differences seem to have small but cumulative effects, aggregating them helps us pool the genetic influence. This is known as a polygenic risk score (PRS). It’s a metric that allows us to estimate the total genomic underpinning of a trait: when the outcome of a GWAS is many genes, totting up their effect is handy. It is a powerful instrument, and a valuable addition to the scientist’s toolkit. Polygenic scores help us to understand the genetics of any human trait, including complex diseases, though not yet with enough detail to warrant clinical intervention. GWAS and PRS are truly brilliant tools that have utterly transformed the field of human genetics.

But this is a tool that is not particularly adept at dissecting the differences between populations. So when we see different IQ scores in different populations, and we know that the heritability of intelligence is high (more than 50 per cent), that doesn’t mean necessarily that the different DNA variants account for the differences between the populations. It would be perfectly possible for two populations with different sets of genetic differences to get the same IQ scores. Take height again, as it is easier to measure and better understood: the many differences in DNA that go some way towards accounting for the differences we see in heights in a population are not genes for height, only ones associated with height. We don’t know what those genetic signatures do, whether they are influencing height or just are physically linked to genes that are important for height, and are going along for the ride due to the way DNA is chopped up when sperm or eggs are made. We also don’t know if the genetic differences are dependent on the local environment to drive the phenotype and make the average taller. We might expect to see different genetic associations in Europe compared to Japan when looking at height, but without knowing what those genes do, we can’t know whether they have drifted into being, are significant, or are really meaningful in different environments, with different food or nutrition. These are not questions that this type of genetic study can answer well. GWAS are important and powerful for finding genes of relevance within a population – but not between different populations. This, I will not dispute, is difficult technical science and statistical analysis. But it is important in the ongoing discussions about intelligence and race. We get better at forensically unpicking groups of people, and the tools become easier to deploy. That doesn’t mean the tools are the right ones for the job. Scientists studying human variation, and journalists and readers need to be wary of drawing wrong conclusions from right results. Since the birth of the GWAS, results have frequently been vastly misreported: weak correlations claimed as causes, typically in the format ‘scientists discover the gene for X’. With the development of the polygenic score on top of the GWAS, we run the risk of further overinterpretation, or outright error."""

Let’s pretend that the genes being selected relate to power and strength, and by extension, that translates into a sprinting advantage, even though slave breeding programmes were not for fast running. Why then do Eastern Europeans dominate weightlifting, and are absent in sprinting, when slavery selection for power would be perfectly attuned to this sport, much more so than running? Why do African Americans dominate in boxing, but not wrestling? Why is it that a game such as squash, which also requires explosive energy and power, is dominated by athletes from India, Pakistan, Egypt and Great Britain, and has never featured a successful person of African descent?

Is Williams’ success a result of her ancestry? Yes, in a narrow sense, in that her assumed genetic make-up bestows part of her advantage. But the question is this: is her ancestry the defining characteristic of her success? That a black woman is a true great is partially a reflection of the lowering of prejudice and raising of opportunity in the modern era. By being one of the greatest tennis players of all time, just like Usain Bolt is the fastest runner ever recorded, they are already wonderfully freakish outliers and poor representatives of normal humans. Are they outliers genetically? For sprinting, there is a notable and blindingly obvious fact that is forever ignored. African American, Caribbean and African Canadian athletes have dominated sprinting for forty years, all descended from the enslaved from West Africa. Only five white men have competed in the Olympic 100 metres finals since the starting pistol was fired in the 1980 race, and the gold and bronze in that race are the only medals not won by black 100 metres sprinters. In that same time, the number of African men in the finals is also five. This includes two medals, both won by Frankie Fredericks from Namibia, a country that is not considered West Africa (rather it is south-west Africa); only one of the five Africans logged a time less than 10 seconds. By this metric, African men are precisely as successful as white men. The transatlantic slave trade also imported millions of West African women and men to South America. The number of South Americans of any ancestry to have competed in the 100 metres finals? Zero. The point is this: elite sprinters in the Olympics are not a dataset on which a statistician could draw any satisfactory conclusion. Yet it is precisely the data on which an extremely popular stereotype is based. The idea of black athleticism in sprinting is drawn from a hugely skewed and fatally flawed sample, one which due to the relative absence of West African sprinters doesn’t even support its own hypothesis. If people of West African ancestry have a genetic advantage, why are there few West African sprinters, when slavery does not account for the difference?"""

Rutherford 2020: Jewish people may have been overrepresented in certain jobs -- but those jobs were not intensely cognitively demanding, and any stronger claims demand strong evidence: <https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1228315214> <https://u1lib.org/book/5406846/1a86f7> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/736771760371793940/rutherford2020.pdf> """Though antisemitism is thousands of years old, and Jewish associations with intellectual pursuits are centuries old, much of the current discourse on supposedly innate Jewish cognitive abilities stem from a single study in 2006. In a paper that has had significant influence – and initiated much scrutiny – Gregory Cochran, Jason Hardy and Henry Harpending* suggested that the history of Ashkenazi Jews in Europe had the effect of enriching genes associated with intellect. They propose a number of factors unique to Jewish (and specifically Ashkenazi) history that created these favourable conditions for intellectual selection. These include social behaviours, such as endogamy, meaning that they mostly interbred, which created a gene pool which is favourable to natural selection. And ‘they had jobs in which increased IQ strongly favoured economic success, in contrast with other populations, who were mostly peasant farmers’. ‘Winnowing through persecution’ is another suggestion in the paper – somehow, acts of oppression and tyranny resulted in survival of the smartest. The authors, however, are clear in the paper that they can’t explain how that would work, as no such effect is seen in other persecuted people. I find it most strange that you include such guesswork in a scientific study. In response to the assertion that professions involving commerce require high levels of intellect, I am unaware of strong evidence that success in business correlates with significantly above average intelligence. Cochran et al. describe moneylending and other forms of commerce that are presumed to be the preserve of Jews as ‘cognitively demanding jobs’ and that ‘the Ashkenazi niche was so specifically demanding of accounting and management skills’. Presenting this as evidence also sounds pretty sketchy to me. Medieval moneylending is not exactly rocket science and it’s definitely not medieval brain surgery. They also cite specific biological factors and ‘physiological effects that could increase intelligence’. In the ancient days of 2006, we knew less than we do today about neuroscience, and how biochemistry in cells relates to thought and action – but not that much less. Neuroscience is a vibrant field, but the truth is that we still really have very little idea of how neuronal growth and connectivity relates to cognition. If I have succeeded in convincing you that genetics is bewilderingly complicated, apply that to the development of the physical brain and the esoteric nature of thought, and you face one of the great frontiers in science. The suggestion is that some disease genes have specific effects on the growth of neurons, in a way that might enhance IQ. But this reflects a profoundly simplistic view of neurological development."""
Rutherford 2020: Jewish domination of moneylending came to an end in the 15th century; although more Jews per person than Christians may have been moneylenders, it was a very small proportion of both: <https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1228315214> <https://u1lib.org/book/5406846/1a86f7> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/736771760371793940/rutherford2020.pdf> """Notionally a positive attribute, an evolutionary history that has fomented intellectual and commercial success is a major part of the standard and longstanding tropes of antisemitism. But the argument is riven with antisemitic tropes that are ahistorical. Moneylending is a common stereotype, not least because of Shakespeare’s Shylock. In fact, moneylending was a trade that was extremely limited in time and space within Jewish culture in Europe, and by the end of the fifteenth century had largely vanished from Jewish populations. Yet the implication of Cochran et al.’s scientific speculation is that business and financial acumen has driven the evolution of Jewish brains."""
Rutherford 2020: the genes hypothesized by breathless adaptationists to cause greater Jewish intelligence have not yet even shown a correlation in GWAS to date: <https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1228315214> <https://u1lib.org/book/5406846/1a86f7> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/736771760371793940/rutherford2020.pdf> """They did not know this at the time of writing their paper, but we now know that the genes associated with intellectual capability are myriad, and of very small but cumulative effect – pixels on a colossal screen. Of the genes identified so far (and remember that while we know these genes are important, we don’t know what they do, and therefore why they are important), many are expressed in the brain (as indeed are thousands of genes), and therefore may well have a direct effect on intellect. There are databases that list hundreds of GWAS results and thousands of genes. You can enter a gene and ask the database to pull out studies that indicate the gene is associated with any one of dozens of types of trait, from height to mortality to bones, as well as cognitive and neurological. I checked the current databases for the disease genes that Cochran et al. suggest might be driving selection for Jewish smarts, to see if, at the time of writing, they associated with brains or cognitive abilities. The result? Not one of them does."""
Rutherford 2020: it's simpler to suggest that culture causes high Jewish educational and economic performance: <https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1228315214> <https://u1lib.org/book/5406846/1a86f7> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/736771760371793940/rutherford2020.pdf> """The evidence for selection of genes for intellect in Jews is weak. Is it not simply more scientifically parsimonious to suggest that a culture that values scholarship is more likely to produce scholars? The immense intellectual value placed on the traditions of yeshivot Talmudic scholarship began in the Middle Ages and continues to this day, and is arguably without parallel. Just like a society that champions long-distance running as a pathway to economic and cultural success, with highly successful runners already in place, a multitude will chase them."""

It is founded on the belief that what is pragmatically possible is not fixed independently of our imaginations, but is itself shaped by our visions. Self-fulfilling prophecies are powerful forces in history, and while it may be polyannish to say ‘where there is a will there is a way’, it is certainly true that without ‘will’ many ‘ways’ become impossible. Nurturing clear-sighted understandings of what it would take to create social institutions free of oppression is part of creating a political will for radical social changes to reduce oppression. A vital belief in a utopian destination may be necessary to motivate people to leave on the journey from the status quo in the first place, even though the actual destination may fall short of the utopian ideal."""

# the theoretical evidence is unclear

The profits of firms are distributed to many owners, who have no direct control over decisions which affect profitability, and who are in large part not responsible for firms’ successes or failures, Firms are run by hired agents of their owners: this suggests that hired agents could as well run firms in a socialist economy, one in which profits would be distributed even more diffusely than they are in the large capitalist corporation. Indeed the mechanisms that have evolved (or been designed) under capitalism that enable owners to control management can be transported to a socialist framework. In contrast to the ‘thin’ Hayekian and neoclassical views, which see markets as a minimal structure organizing competition among talented individuals, the modern ‘thick’ view sees markets as operating within the context of complex, man-made institutions, through which all individual contributions become pasteurized and refined. These two views of the market are, I suggest, substantially different, and the latter ‘thick’ view, unlike the former, is amenable to the coexistence of markets and socialism."""

Schweickart 2016: Economic Democracy: <https://thenextsystem.org/node/204>
Schweickart 2011: mere critique of capitalism is insufficient, a successor system is necessary: <https://www.google.com/books/edition/After_Capitalism/X0sBA_ya34gC> <https://u1lib.org/book/5558600/b5b825> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/827934025355624498/schweickart2011.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/864202322557272104/unknown.png https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/864202720764493924/unknown.png But there was a problem. Marx’s critique of capitalism, which acknowledges its accomplishments while laying bare its exploitative underpinnings and irrational dynamic, remains just that: critique. Marx offers no model for an alternative economic order, no “recipes for cookshops of the future,” in his disdainful phrase. [....] [H]istorical materialism claims that capitalism, the dominant economic system of Marx’s day and our own, will be superseded by a more rational order. This successor system has been traditionally called “socialism,” and has been viewed as itself a stage on the way to a higher “communism.” But as anyone who has studied Marx knows, there is a blank page at precisely this point in his theory. Marx says almost nothing as to what this “socialism” would look like. Virtually no attention is given to the institutional structures that are to replace those of capitalism and thus define an economic order genuinely superior to capitalism.
Schweickart 2011: like progressive christians, we should be inspired by past socialist movements but not seek to defend their every action: <https://www.google.com/books/edition/After_Capitalism/X0sBA_ya34gC> <https://u1lib.org/book/5558600/b5b825> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/827934025355624498/schweickart2011.pdf>  The counterproject must keep the tradition alive without denying the shortcomings and failures—sometimes horrific—of individuals, parties, and governments that have called themselves socialist or communist. This is not so strange. Consider the parallel with Christianity. Progressive Christians draw strength and inspiration from the Christian tradition without denying the inquisitions, religious wars, corruption, and abuse that are also a part of Christianity’s history. There are values, and lives committed to those values, in both traditions (essentially the same values—as liberation theologians have demonstrated) that continue to inspire.
Schweickart 2011: socialists should not reject "liberal values" merely because they were liberal: <https://www.google.com/books/edition/After_Capitalism/X0sBA_ya34gC> <https://u1lib.org/book/5558600/b5b825> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/827934025355624498/schweickart2011.pdf> The counterproject, as it develops, will have to be a dialectical socialism, not a nihilistic socialism. 12 Its aim is not to negate the existing order, wipe everything out and start over, but to create a new order that preserves what is good in the present while mitigating its irrationality and evil. The counter-project will not be what Marx decried as “crude communism,” a communism animated by envy, which wants to level down and destroy whatever cannot be enjoyed by all. 13 It will be a project that builds on the material and cultural accomplishments of past centuries. It will embrace the political ideals of liberty, democracy, and the rule of law. It will endorse and promote such values as generosity, solidarity, and human creativity, and also self-discipline, personal responsibility, and hard work. It will not sneer at any of these ideals or values as “bourgeois.” They will be regarded as indispensable to the construction of a new and better world.

Lenin 1917: on democracy, democracy is socialism: <https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/ch05.htm> <https://www.marxists.org/ebooks/lenin/state-and-revolution.pdf> """Democracy means equality. The great significance of the proletariat's struggle for equality and of equality as a slogan will be clear if we correctly interpret it as meaning the abolition of classes. But democracy means only formal equality. And as soon as equality is achieved for all members of society in relation to ownership of the means of production, that is, equality of labor and wages, humanity will inevitably be confronted with the question of advancing further from formal equality to actual equality, i.e., to the operation of the rule "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs". By what stages, by means of what practical measures humanity will proceed to this supreme aim we do not and cannot know. But it is important to realize how infinitely mendacious is the ordinary bourgeois conception of socialism as something lifeless, rigid, fixed once and for all, whereas in reality only socialism will be the beginning of a rapid, genuine, truly mass forward movement, embracing first the majority and then the whole of the population, in all spheres of public and private life. Democracy is of enormous importance to the working class in its struggle against the capitalists for its emancipation. But democracy is by no means a boundary not to be overstepped; it is only one of the stages on the road from feudalism to capitalism, and from capitalism to communism. Democracy is a form of the state, it represents, on the one hand, the organized, systematic use of force against persons; but, on the other hand, it signifies the formal recognition of equality of citizens, the equal right of all to determine the structure of, and to administer, the state. This, in turn, results in the fact that, at a certain stage in the development of democracy, it first welds together the class that wages a revolutionary struggle against capitalism--the proletariat, and enables it to crush, smash to atoms, wipe off the face of the earth the bourgeois, even the republican-bourgeois, state machine, the standing army, the police and the bureaucracy and to substitute for them a more democratic state machine, but a state machine nevertheless, in the shape of armed workers who proceed to form a militia involving the entire population. Here "quantity turns into quality": such a degree of democracy implies overstepping the boundaries of bourgeois society and beginning its socialist reorganization. If really all take part in the administration of the state, capitalism cannot retain its hold."""
Lenin 1917: on the transition from capitalism to socialism: <https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/ch05.htm> <https://www.marxists.org/ebooks/lenin/state-and-revolution.pdf> """The development of capitalism, in turn, creates the preconditions that enable really “all” to take part in the administration of the state. Some of these preconditions are: universal literacy, which has already been achieved in a number of the most advanced capitalist countries, then the "training and disciplining" of millions of workers by the huge, complex, socialized apparatus of the postal service, railways, big factories, large-scale commerce, banking, etc., etc. Given these economic preconditions, it is quite possible, after the overthrow of the capitalists and the bureaucrats, to proceed immediately, overnight, to replace them in the control over production and distribution, in the work of keeping account of labor and products, by the armed workers, by the whole of the armed population. (The question of control and accounting should not be confused with the question of the scientifically trained staff of engineers, agronomists, and so on. These gentlemen are working today in obedience to the wishes of the capitalists and will work even better tomorrow in obedience to the wishes of the armed workers.) Accounting and control--that is mainly what is needed for the "smooth working", for the proper functioning, of the first phase of communist society. All citizens are transformed into hired employees of the state, which consists of the armed workers. All citizens becomes employees and workers of a single countrywide state “syndicate”. All that is required is that they should work equally, do their proper share of work, and get equal pay; the accounting and control necessary for this have been simplified by capitalism to the utmost and reduced to the extraordinarily simple operations--which any literate person can perform--of supervising and recording, knowledge of the four rules of arithmetic, and issuing appropriate receipts."""
Lenin 1917: on the transition from socialism to communism: <https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/ch05.htm> <https://www.marxists.org/ebooks/lenin/state-and-revolution.pdf> """When the majority of the people begin independently and everywhere to keep such accounts and exercise such control over the capitalists (now converted into employees) and over the intellectual gentry who preserve their capitalist habits, this control will really become universal, general, and popular; and there will be no getting away from it, there will be "nowhere to go". The whole of society will have become a single office and a single factory, with equality of labor and pay. But this “factory” discipline, which the proletariat, after defeating the capitalists, after overthrowing the exploiters, will extend to the whole of society, is by no means our ideal, or our ultimate goal. It is only a necessary step for thoroughly cleansing society of all the infamies and abominations of capitalist exploitation, and for further progress. From the moment all members of society, or at least the vast majority, have learned to administer the state themselves, have taken this work into their own hands, have organized control over the insignificant capitalist minority, over the gentry who wish to preserve their capitalist habits and over the workers who have been thoroughly corrupted by capitalism--from this moment the need for government of any kind begins to disappear altogether. The more complete the democracy, the nearer the moment when it becomes unnecessary. The more democratic the “state” which consists of the armed workers, and which is "no longer a state in the proper sense of the word", the more rapidly every form of state begins to wither away. For when all have learned to administer and actually to independently administer social production, independently keep accounts and exercise control over the parasites, the sons of the wealthy, the swindlers and other "guardians of capitalist traditions", the escape from this popular accounting and control will inevitably become so incredibly difficult, such a rare exception, and will probably be accompanied by such swift and severe punishment (for the armed workers are practical men and not sentimental intellectuals, and they scarcely allow anyone to trifle with them), that the necessity of observing the simple, fundamental rules of the community will very soon become a habit. Then the door will be thrown wide open for the transition from the first phase of communist society to its higher phase, and with it to the complete withering away of the state."""
